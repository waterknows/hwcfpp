JOHANNESBURG — Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first black president, was discharged from a hospital on Saturday after a nine-day stay to receive treatment for pneumonia, the South African government said.Mr. Mandela, who is 94 and in frail health, has been hospitalized three times in the past four months. He has suffered from repeated lung infections, a legacy of the tuberculosis he contracted during his 27 years as a political prisoner of the white-minority government in South Africa.Mr. Mandela was discharged from the hospital, whose name was not disclosed, “following a sustained and gradual improvement in his general condition,” said a statement released by the office of President Jacob Zuma.Mr. Mandela will continue to receive high-level medical care at his home in Johannesburg, the statement said.In his years in prison, Mr. Mandela became a symbol of South Africa’s struggle to throw off the oppressive system of strict racial separation known as apartheid, which deprived anyone who was not white of basic human rights.He emerged in 1990 and led South Africa through a difficult but largely peaceful transition to full democracy, emphasizing forgiveness of his former captors and forswearing vengeance. He was elected president in 1994 but left office after a single term. He retired from public life in 2004 and has not been seen publicly since 2010.
