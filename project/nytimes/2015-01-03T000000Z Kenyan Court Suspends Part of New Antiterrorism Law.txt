A Kenyan court on Friday suspended some of the most contentious provisions of a new security law that detractors have said would undermine democracy.The High Court blocked some of the law’s restrictions on news media organizations and provisions related to refugees until further hearings could be held. The president of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, in December urged Parliament to pass the law as soon as possible, saying it was necessary to combat terrorism.Fistfights broke out on the Parliament floor while the measures were being debated, with opposition members furious about the law, which they said was tantamount to dictatorship.Kenya has suffered dozens of terrorist attacks in recent years, but it is also widely seen as one of Africa’s most open and developed democracies.Also on Friday, a university student was jailed for insulting Mr. Kenyatta on Facebook, according to Kenya’s leading newspaper, Daily Nation.
