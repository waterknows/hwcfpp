LONDON — Britain’s ambitions to produce natural gas from shale rock were set back on Monday when a local government rejected a company’s drilling plan.Lancashire County Council, in Northwest England, turned down a request by the shale gas explorer Cuadrilla Resources to drill four wells at a site called Preston New Road and test them with hydraulic fracturing, which involves pumping water and other material down wells to break open the rock to allow gas to flow.If it had been approved, the Cuadrilla application might have led to the first major fracking tests in shale in Britain since a Cuadrilla fracking project at a well near Blackpool, the Irish Sea resort also in Lancashire, set off earth tremors in 2011.The decision on Monday was a blow for the government of Prime Minister David Cameron, which hopes to create a domestic shale industry to help offset declining production of oil and natural gas from the North Sea. The government wants to emulate the success of the United States, where the shale industry has unleashed an oil and gas boom that has reshaped global energy markets.Calling the rejection “disappointing,” the British energy minister, Andrea Leadsom, said in a statement that “shale gas has huge potential in the U.K. and is an opportunity to develop a new, homegrown energy source that would displace imports and create thousands of jobs.” She said she was “confident that potential will be realized.”Before the vote, councilors spoke emotionally against the plan, saying that it would mar the landscape, create unacceptable levels of noise and might also saddle the county with pollution problems years down the road. The rejection was greeted with applause by shale opponents.In a statement on Monday, Greenpeace called the decision “a Waterloo for the fracking industry and a triumph for local democracy.” It said the decision sent “a powerful signal to other councils that the fracking juggernaut can indeed be stopped.”Cuadrilla said in a statement that it was “surprised and disappointed” by the decision and that the company “will now take time to consider our options regarding an appeal.”The company said that its environmental assessments demonstrated that shale exploration and production “can and will be conducted safely and without damage to people’s health or their environment.”Work by the British Geological Survey, a research organization, has shown that Britain has large quantities of shale gas in place, but how much, if any, can be commercially extracted will not be known until a sizable number of wells are drilled and tested with hydraulic fracturing.As things stand in Britain, drilling and fracking require the approval of local governments, which at present means extensive paperwork and long waits. Cuadrilla submitted its applications in Lancashire more than a year ago, after months of work.“Clearly, the current regime is not fit for the government’s purpose of gaining a social licence to frack,” Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwich Business School, wrote in an email.Lengthy procedures can drain a small company’s financial resources, yet a handful of companies, small and large, are pursuing shale development in Britain, calculating that a worthwhile opportunity remains despite the planning difficulties. Ineos, a global petrochemical giant, has been acquiring shale licenses in Britain, with hopes of using the fuel to power its energy-hungry plants.While anything labeled shale encounters enormous resistance, Britain does have a small onshore oil and gas industry that operates with few problems. “We have a long history of onshore exploration in the U.K. and have successfully mitigated noise and traffic impacts at other onshore locations,” Stephen Bowler, chief executive of IGas Energy, an onshore operator that also holds shale licenses, said in a statement.This month, members of the Lancashire council’s planning staff recommended that the council allow Cuadrilla to drill at the site rejected on Monday. Northwest England is considered to have significant shale gas potential, and residents were presumed to be less opposed to drilling than in some other areas of the country, like the South.The decision, which had long been delayed, followed another move by the council last week to block drilling at a Lancashire site called Roseacre Wood.
