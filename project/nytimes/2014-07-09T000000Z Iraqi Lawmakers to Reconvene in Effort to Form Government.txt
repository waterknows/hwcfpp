BAGHDAD —  The Iraqi Parliament on Tuesday set its next meeting for Sunday as it tries again to form a new government after a failed attempt last week.While the effort to form a government continued, fighting in northern and western Sunni provinces continued with no decisive movement on either side, but with airstrikes on Sunni militant positions in Tikrit and moves by militants to take more villages in northeastern Salahuddin Province.It was unclear whether there would be any progress on Sunday or enough lawmakers present to form a quorum.Parliament’s administrative office had told lawmakers on Monday that there would be no session until Aug. 12. That announcement was met with dismay by other nations, which have been urging Iraq to act quickly to form a government that reflects the country’s diverse and often hostile religious sects and ethnic groups.On Tuesday, the temporary speaker, Mahdi al-Hafith, announced that Parliament would attempt to meet on Sunday “in order to safeguard the public interest and continue to build democracy.”The first step under the Constitution is to elect a speaker, and within a month to name a president and two vice presidents. Two weeks after that, Parliament is required to choose a prime minister.Though elected in April, Parliament has not yet formed a government, in part because there is antagonism toward Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. There now seems to be a focused effort to remove Mr. Maliki and find an acceptable alternative. Mr. Maliki, however, is pursuing a third term and is using his position as commander in chief to portray himself as crucial to holding the army together.There is no consensus candidate yet for prime minister.In northern and western Iraq, both the Sunni militants led by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and Iraqi government forces attempted to make gains.In Tikrit, the capital of Salahuddin Province, Iraqi forces bombed buildings they believed were ISIS positions, but also dropped leaflets urging Tikritis to support them and fight ISIS.In Al Qaim, on the western Iraqi border with Syria, three witnesses said they saw a drone fly in from Syria and drop a bomb on the military headquarters in the town. In Samarra, a town north of Baghdad, a suicide bomber detonated himself near the headquarters of the security command center, killing five people and wounding four others, according to an officer in the command center.The United Nations also made public on Tuesday a letter from the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations that said the government had lost a former chemical weapons facility to “armed terrorist groups.”
