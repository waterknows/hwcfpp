WASHINGTON —  Federal officials have warned government employees here that the arrival next week of 50 African leaders — and their motorcades — will bring city traffic to a standstill during a two-day White House summit meeting about issues on the continent.In an email to top officials at federal offices, the nation’s personnel chief urged agencies to let their workers stay at home during the event, which takes place next Tuesday and Wednesday. Traffic is also expected to be snarled on Monday and Thursday as the leaders arrive and leave.“Agencies should consider encouraging employees who can be spared from their duties to request to adjust their work schedules,” Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, wrote Friday in a memo.The two-day gathering was arranged after President Obama visited Africa last year. Officials have said the summit meeting will focus on increasing trade and investment in Africa, improving security and building on the continent’s progress toward democracy.The White House said that all African leaders who are “in good standing” with the United States and the African Union are included. The president did not invite President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, among several others.The leaders are invited to a reception on Capitol Hill on Monday evening, events at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Tuesday morning, a dinner at the White House on Tuesday evening and a series of sessions with Mr. Obama on Wednesday. The first lady, Michelle Obama, and Laura Bush, the former first lady, will be the hosts of the African leaders’ spouses at a daylong symposium at the Kennedy Center.Ms. Archuleta wrote that for now the federal government would remain open Monday through Thursday next week, but she advised federal employees to monitor local news outlets for announcements about potential street closings, disruptions to public transportation or a closing of the federal government.Some of the leaders will be arriving from countries that are experiencing an outbreak of the Ebola virus, but officials at the White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that the government was not taking any specific precautions.“We believe air travel continues to be safe, and the C.D.C. has stated there is no significant risk in the United States from the current Ebola outbreak,” Edward Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said in an email.The World Health Organization has said that the more than 1,000 cases of confirmed Ebola infection in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone represent the worst-ever outbreak of the deadly disease, a hemorrhagic fever that has no known cure and a death rate that approaches 90 percent.A spokesman for the C.D.C. said procedures were already in place to stem the spread of Ebola, and flight crews and airline personnel will generally not allow a sick passenger to board a plane.The spokesman, Jason McDonald, said, “There are no plans or indications that we’re going to take any additional precautions with the leaders who are coming.”
