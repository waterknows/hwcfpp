SOCHI, Russia — On the track, the race belonged to the British driver Lewis Hamilton, who has won 9 of the 16 Formula One races this year and placed himself in contention to win the 2014 world driver’s championship.But in every other sense, the inaugural Russian Grand Prix, run on Sunday in this Olympic city on the Black Sea, belonged to Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who made a carefully staged entry into a V.I.P. enclosure on the main straight, three-quarters of the way through the race; collected a lifetime pass for Formula One races around the world; and presented Hamilton with the winner’s trophy.Putin’s aides like to tell the story of him driving a Renault Formula One car on an open road near St. Petersburg four years ago after the deal to hold a Russian race was signed. Perhaps advisedly, he left the driving on Sunday to the professionals, restricting himself to a somewhat stilted conversation with the first three finishers as they toweled themselves down.In Russian, Putin, 62, asked how much weight the drivers lost during a grand prix. “Three liters,” the runner-up, Nico Rosberg, replied, referring to the dehydrating effect of the 90 minutes of racing. Rosberg, Hamilton’s German teammate at Mercedes, had provided what little excitement there was in an otherwise processional race by climbing through the 21-car field after pitting with flat-spotted tires at the end of the first lap.For Putin, like Hamilton, the Russian race was a start-to-finish affair. The grand prix was conceived several years ago at a meeting in his Kremlin office with Bernie Ecclestone, the secretive autocrat who runs Formula One out of his back pocket, and was contested on a new 3.6-mile, $200 million track wound around the Olympic stadiums from the Winter Games held here in February. Many Russians have seen the tens of billions of dollars spent in Sochi as Putin’s monument to himself as the man with the vision to make Russia great again.That, at least, was the official script, which, despite deep unease in some quarters of Formula One, Ecclestone, 83, has seemed happy to support.Long before Putin’s arrival, standard Formula One starting-line procedures were set aside for an elaborate tableau that included hundreds of performers skipping down the main straight with quarter-mile stretches of fabric in the colors of the Russian flag. The drivers were then lined up like an honor guard at the front of the grid — awkwardly, as some said later — for the Russian national anthem, followed by a short silence for Jules Bianchi, a French driver who sustained severe brain injuries last weekend in a race in Japan.The pièce de résistance, though, was a Cossack-themed performance in which dozens of dancers whirled down the starting grid with flashing swords — perhaps a self-conscious reminder that Russia’s czars used the combative Cossacks over the centuries to push the frontiers of their empire south to the Black Sea and east to the Pacific.But there was another narrative not embraced by Ecclestone or Putin, and it pointed northwest about 320 miles, to southeastern Ukraine, where a Malaysian airliner crashed on July 17. American officials said at the time that a surface-to-air missile was responsible and blamed pro-Russian rebels; evidence released by Dutch investigators was consistent with the assertion of a missile attack.The crash, which killed 298 people, gave impetus to demands across the world for stricter sanctions against Russia, which extended to calls for the cancellation of the Russian Grand Prix, a race that has been part of Ecclestone’s own bid to push south and east, with Formula One.For more than a decade, Ecclestone has been busy tying up lucrative deals to stage races with governments outside Formula One’s traditional sphere in Western Europe and in countries with deep state coffers but only a nodding acquaintance with Western notions of democracy and human rights.Ecclestone has unceremoniously dropped races in countries like France, where the first grand prix was held in 1906, and embraced new host nations across the Middle East and Asia that have been eager for the prestige associated with the high-technology carnival of Formula One, and for the shop window provided by a TV audience of hundreds of millions.Abu Dhabi, China and Bahrain have been on the roster for years, and Russia, in the negotiations overseen by Putin, pledged to pay a reported $40 million a year to stage races in Sochi for seven years. That, and the building of a track to Ecclestone’s specifications, is part of a wider plan to sustain the $1.5 billion in revenue Ecclestone husbands each year, the largest chunk of it retained by the London-based investment company CVC Capital Partners, the sport’s majority owner.Ecclestone has only recently emerged from a dark passage of his own in which he was the defendant in a Munich criminal case accusing him of paying a $44 million bribe to a German banker who helped secure CVC’s purchase of Formula One in 2006, and with it Ecclestone’s continued control of the sport.In August, he used a loophole in German law to settle the case, with no finding of guilt or innocence, by making a personal payment of $100 million to the Bavarian state court; the amount was a fraction of his fortune of $4.1 billion, according to a recent Forbes estimate.Although freed from the distractions of the four-month trial, and vowing to return to “business as usual,” Ecclestone has emerged from the trial a somewhat weakened figure, with recent reports suggesting the holding company that controls CVC, Delta Topco, had not reappointed him to its board. Ecclestone has denied those reports.Ecclestone faced a minor revolt within Formula One over the Russian race when Ari Vatanen, a former world rally champion and a senior official of motor sports’ world governing body, called for the Sochi race to be scrapped to keep Formula One from appearing to condone the Russian aggression in Ukraine.But Ecclestone held firm. A self-professed admirer of strong leaders who once apologized for describing Adolf Hitler as a man who was “able to get things done,” he has listed the former Soviet ruler Leonid Brezhnev — with whom he negotiated unsuccessfully for a race around the Kremlin in the 1980s — among the men he most admires.He has listed Putin, too, in that category, telling a Moscow-based business newspaper, Vedomosti, in an interview published last week that he viewed Putin as “a first-class man” and suggesting that Putin could run Europe or America, “but I think he’s busy.”
