OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — Burkina Faso’s interim president, Michel Kafando, and prime minister, Isaac Zida, who were ousted in a coup this week, have been released from detention, a military spokesman said on Friday. Protests continued in the capital, Ouagadougou.The two men were seized Wednesday evening when the military raided a cabinet meeting. Gen. Gilbert Diendéré, a close ally of Blaise Compaoré, who ruled the country for 27 years until last October, has taken charge.The spokesman, Lt. Col. Mamadou Bamba, said that Mr. Zida would remain under house arrest. He also said the new military government had reached out to representatives from the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union on Thursday night.The military junta, calling itself the National Council for Democracy, said in a statement that it “accepts the principle of mediation and reaffirms its intention not to stay in power for a long time.” It also reopened the country’s borders.However, the African Union on Friday condemned the coup and suspended Burkina Faso as a member. The Economic Community of West African States said its chairman, President Macky Sall of Senegal, along with President Thomas Boni Yayi of Benin, arrived in Ouagadougou on Friday to make an attempt at mediation.
