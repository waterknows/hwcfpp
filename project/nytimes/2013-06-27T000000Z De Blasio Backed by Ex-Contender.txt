A former front-running Democratic presidential candidate has decided to wade into the New York City mayor’s race by backing Bill de Blasio, the public advocate.No, not Hillary Rodham Clinton.Howard Dean, the onetime governor of Vermont who electrified liberals in 2004 before stumbling after his “scream” moment, will hold a fund-raiser for Mr. de Blasio in Brooklyn on July 18. And in a statement, he called Mr. de Blasio, who served as the campaign manager for Mrs. Clinton’s 2000 Senate race, “the clear progressive choice.”“As a lifelong progressive reformer and grass-roots organizer, Bill will take on the elite who profit from the status quo at the expense of working families,” Mr. Dean said.It is the first time that Mr. Dean has backed a candidate in a New York City mayoral primary.Mr. Dean’s political action committee, Democracy for America, has been active in recent years supporting liberal candidates in local races against Republicans, including in Virginia.Another mayoral candidate, Christine C. Quinn, picked up her own celebrity endorsement on Wednesday: Edith Windsor, the plaintiff who sued to have the Defense of Marriage Act overturned.
