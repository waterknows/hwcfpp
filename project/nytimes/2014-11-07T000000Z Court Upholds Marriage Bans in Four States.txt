A federal appeals court in Ohio upheld on Thursday the right of four states to ban same-sex marriage, contradicting rulings by four similar courts and almost certainly sending the issue on a rapid trajectory to the Supreme Court.The much-anticipated decision, written by Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, an appointee of George W. Bush, overturned lower court rulings in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that were in favor of same-sex marriage.“This is the circuit split that will almost surely produce a decision from the Supreme Court, and sooner rather than later,” said Dale Carpenter, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota. “It’s entirely possible that we could have oral arguments in coming months and a Supreme Court decision by next summer.”In Thursday’s 2-to-1 decision, by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, Judge Sutton said that it appears almost inevitable that American law will allow gay couples to marry. But the more fundamental question, he wrote, is: “Who decides?”Judge Sutton said that such a profound change in the institution of marriage should be decided not by “an intermediate court” like his, but by “the less expedient, but usually reliable, work of the state democratic processes.”He dismissed the reasoning issued over the last year by numerous other federal courts, which have held that barring same-sex marriage violates equal protection or due process clauses of the Constitution and has no convincing rationale.Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell University Law School professor, said that “the essence of this opinion is that the issue should be left to the democratic process or to the Supreme Court, but I’m not going to do this as an appeals court judge.”In a stinging dissent, Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, an appointee of Bill Clinton, called the majority opinion “a largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism” that treated the couples involved in the cases as “mere abstractions” rather than as real people suffering harm because they were denied equal status.Gay rights groups and lawyers for the plaintiffs in the four affected states expressed disappointment and anger.“We’re extremely disappointed for the families in these four states, but this decision highlights the need for the U.S. Supreme Court to right this injustice,” said Susan Sommer, director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal, which helped argue one of the six cases involved in Thursday’s decision.The Sixth Circuit decision was not a complete surprise because Judge Sutton had expressed similar concerns about federalism and the democratic process at the hearing on the cases in August. He was joined in the opinion by Judge Deborah L. Cook, another Bush appointee.But since then, the Supreme Court, by declining to hear appeals, has allowed rulings in favor of gay marriage from four other circuit courts to take effect. The number of states with same-sex marriage jumped last month to 32, plus the District of Columbia, with shifts in three more states all but certain.In decisions last month declining to hear appeals, the Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the cases. But by acquiescing in the court-mandated spread of same-sex marriage to many states, it did in effect create a new social reality, making it extremely unlikely, many legal experts say, that the court would now find such bans constitutional.“If the court reversed those decisions, it would create chaos,” said Professor Dorf. “It would seem highly unlikely, but technically they can do it.”Evan Wolfson, the president of Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group, said: “Today’s ruling is completely out of step with the Supreme Court’s clear signal last month, out of step with the constitutional command as recognized by nearly every state and federal court in the past year, and out of step with the majority of the American people.” He called on the Supreme Court to take up the issue quickly and provide national resolution.But conservative opponents of same-sex marriage, who see states-rights arguments as their last best hope in the courts, praised the decision.“The people of every state should remain free to affirm marriage as the union of a man and a woman in their laws,” said Byron Babione, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal group that has argued several same-sex marriage cases. “As the Sixth Circuit rightly concluded, the Constitution does not demand that one irreversible view of marriage be judicially imposed on everyone.”In the cases decided Thursday, couples from Kentucky and Michigan had asked lower courts to overturn state amendments barring same-sex marriage. Couples from Ohio and Tennessee had asked the courts to require the states to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally in other states.“This ruling means that many couples like April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse will continue to be excluded from the protections and responsibilities that come with marriage,” said Equality Michigan, an advocacy group, referring to the plaintiffs in the case there.Many experts had expected the Supreme Court to take on a marriage case this fall. But in September, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the justices might wait — as they in fact have — for a division to emerge among federal circuit courts of appeals.“So far, the federal courts of appeals have answered the question the same way — holding unconstitutional the bans on same-sex marriage,” she told an audience in Minnesota. “There is a case now pending before the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,” she said, referring to the cases decided Thursday.“Now if that court should disagree with the others then there will be some urgency in the court taking the case,” she said.“Sooner or later, yes, the question will come to the court,” she said.
