MEXICO CITY — Luis Guillermo Solís won a landslide victory in Costa Rica’s presidential election on Sunday after his opponent abandoned the contest and retreated to the sidelines.Mr. Solís, a 55-year-old history professor and former diplomat, received almost 78 percent of the vote, according to the Costa Rican electoral tribunal, based on tallies from more than 96 percent of polling places. His victory represents a turn in Costa Rican politics away from the dominant National Liberation Party, or PLN, whose support has withered after a series of corruption scandals.Mr. Solís’s opponent, Johnny Araya of the PLN, announced last month that he would stop campaigning, after opinion polls showed him headed for a crushing defeat. Still, his name remained on the ballot, and the election went ahead as scheduled for Costa Rica’s 3.1 million voters. Mr. Solís left the PLN in 2005 and ran as the candidate of the center-left Citizens Action Party.Turnout was lower than usual because the outcome was not in doubt, but even so, Mr. Solís received more than 1.3 million votes, well above the goal of one million he had set to represent a strong mandate.He will face several challenges, including a divided Congress where the PLN is the largest party, and a growing budget deficit that is expected to reach the equivalent of 6 percent of the country’s gross domestic product this year.Costa Rica’s stable democracy and social safety net have made it a star in Latin America for decades, but it has lost some of its shine in recent years because of rising crime rates and widening economic inequality.One of the new president’s most important tasks will be to “recover people’s confidence in the Costa Rican state,” Luis Mesalles, an analyst, wrote in the newspaper La Nación on Saturday.
