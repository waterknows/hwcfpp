ATHENS —  The issue of how to deal with a surge in racist violence in Greece opened a rift within the country’s fragile governing coalition on Tuesday, when its two junior parties said they would push ahead with an antiracism bill over the objections of the conservative senior party.A rising number of attacks on non-Greeks have occurred in Greece in recent years, as the country’s economic woes have taken hold. An increasingly popular anti-immigrant party of the far right, Golden Dawn, has been broadly linked to the violence.The issue has set off the most intense dispute within the government since it was cobbled together after inconclusive elections last June, when the country’s solvency and future in the euro zone hung in the balance.Talks among the leaders of the three coalition parties over the antiracism bill broke down on Monday night, with the socialist party, Pasok, and the moderate Democratic Left insisting that the bill go to Parliament immediately.The conservative New Democracy party countered that the existing legislative framework was adequate and required no amendment.Pasok and the Democratic Left said Tuesday that they would submit the bill anyway, without the backing of the conservatives, whom both have accused of governing without due consultation with the smaller parties. In doing so, the two parties defied the conservative prime minister, Antonis Samaras.The stated aim of the antiracism bill, drafted by the justice minister, Antonis Roupakiotis of the Democratic Left, is to impose tougher penalties for inciting racist attacks: up to two years in prison and fines of up to about $26,000 for individuals or $260,000 for organizations.But the bill is also intended to curb the growing influence of Golden Dawn, which ranks third in national opinion polls, after the conservatives and the main leftist opposition party, Syriza.Late on Monday, the Pasok leader, Evangelos Venizelos, made it clear that the bill was aimed at Golden Dawn, saying that “Greece has a political grouping that is unashamedly Nazi and organizes acts violating the rule of law.”Syriza and other critics of the government have accused the conservatives of turning against the antiracism bill, which they originally supported, out of reluctance to face down Golden Dawn and because representatives of the powerful Orthodox Church and the armed forces oppose the bill, saying it would curb freedom of speech.Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Commission’s home affairs commissioner, visited Athens last week and expressed concern about an increase in racially motivated attacks and the rising popularity of Golden Dawn.Ms. Malmstrom said Tuesday that she hoped the bill would be submitted to the Greek Parliament “as promised.”Golden Dawn catapulted from obscurity last June to win seats in Parliament for the first time after campaigning on a heavily anti-immigrant platform.In the splintered Greek political landscape, the party has been attracting about 10 percent support in recent polls; the largest party, New Democracy, gets about 20 percent, with Syriza around two percentage points behind.
