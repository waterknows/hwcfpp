OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso —  Despite often rancorous discussion brokered by three African presidents, political and military leaders in Burkina Faso have failed to name a civilian to lead a transition to democracy after the resignation of President Blaise Compaoré.According to a statement late Wednesday from the leaders of Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal, the country’s fractious contenders have agreed to the outlines of a plan — intended in part to avert African Union and American sanctions — to restore the Constitution and begin a path to elections by November next year.The talks in Ouagadougou, the capital of this poor, landlocked West African nation, followed a convulsion of violent protest last week that led to Mr. Compaoré’s exit. Thousands of protesters surged through the city, setting fire to buildings including the Parliament and marching on the presidential palace.Mr. Compaoré fled to Ivory Coast with the aid of France, the former colonial power, which still exerts enormous influence in the region and maintains a special forces base in Burkina Faso as part of an international effort to combat Islamic militants.In the chaos surrounding Mr. Compaoré’s departure, the military suspended the Constitution and named a presidential guard officer, Lt. Col. Isaac Zida, as the country’s interim leader.The three African presidents — John Dramani Mahama of Ghana, Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria and Macky Sall of Senegal — consulted with a wide range of individuals, including traditional leaders, religious figures, opposition groups and the military, according to their statement.The factions agreed to “immediately” restore the Constitution to establish an interim government and to “urgently designate by consensus a suitably eminent civilian to lead the transition.”They also agreed “to form a transitional government for a period of one year” and “organize presidential and legislative elections by November 2015.”
