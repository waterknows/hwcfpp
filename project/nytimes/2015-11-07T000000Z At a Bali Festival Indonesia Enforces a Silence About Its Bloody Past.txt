JAKARTA, Indonesia —  In the past 12 years, the annual Ubud Writers and Readers Festival on the Indonesian resort island of Bali has earned praise for its provocative panel discussions, book introductions and film screenings.But during this year’s five-day gathering, which ended last Sunday, it was what the international festival did not present that caused the biggest stir.Just days before the gathering opened to the first of nearly 30,000 visitors, the local authorities in the Balinese town of Ubud ordered its organizers to cancel eight events related to the bloodiest period in modern Indonesian history: the killings of an estimated 500,000 or more people during state-sponsored purges of suspected Communists and their sympathizers in 1965-66.The authorities’ directive was part of a widespread pattern. Although the 50th anniversary of the trigger for those killings passed last month with little notice aside from a few news stories, officials have lately begun cracking down on any exploration, analysis or remembrance of the purges.Last month, a 77-year-old Indonesian who holds a Swedish passport was deported and reportedly placed on a blacklist that would prevent him from re-entering Indonesia after being detained by the police on Sumatra. He had been trying to visit a mass grave where his father was buried after being killed in the purges.Also last month, the police in Central Java Province confiscated and destroyed 500 copies of a university magazine featuring an in-depth report on the purges and, according to human rights activists, threatened to have the students responsible for the report expelled.All told, there have been at least 27 similar events in the past year, including intimidation, threats and official prohibitions by the police, the armed forces and government agencies, according to the Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy, a rights advocacy group in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.A local military command in the Central Java city of Yogyakarta even confiscated 27 toys from vendors that had “Communist” symbols, including the flag of the former Soviet Union, fearing they would prompt children to explore the ideology, The Jakarta Globe newspaper reported on Friday.Among the events canceled at the festival in Bali, billed as the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia, were the screening of a documentary and the debut of a book, both by Joshua Oppenheimer, an American whose 2012 film about the purges, “The Act of Killing,” was nominated for an Academy Award last year.The authorities who ordered the cancellations, who the festival organizers said included Bali-based government, military and police officials, threatened to revoke the organizers’ permit for this year as well as 2016, and implied that anyone defying their demands would be arrested.Janet DeNeefe, the festival’s Australian founder and director, who has lived in Bali for more than 30 years, characterized those tactics as “bullying and threats.”Although she said the festival organizers had capitulated to avoid a complete shutdown, she noted that the orders had ultimately backfired.“Even though the programs were removed, everybody is talking about it,” she said. “And that’s a good thing.”The 1965-66 massacres, carried out by soldiers and by civilian, paramilitary and religious groups backed by the military, were provoked by the failed uprising of an officer-led group within the Indonesian armed forces that kidnapped and executed six army generals beginning the night of Sept. 30, 1965.Within days, top commanders quashed the uprising, which they called an attempted coup orchestrated by the powerful Indonesian Communist Party and rogue military personnel. The purges that followed — victims were branded as Communists, but they also included intellectuals, ethnic Chinese Indonesians and countless others — were overseen by Suharto, an army general who went on to become the country’s president and to preside over an authoritarian, military-backed government for 32 years.Mr. Suharto was forced to resign in 1998 after mass pro-democracy demonstrations, and died in 2008.On Oct. 24, a group of 136 people, including prominent Indonesian and foreign writers and academics, released a joint statement condemning the current crackdown and called on the government to “guarantee the safety of those who wish and plan to discuss, review and investigate the 1965 tragedy from all kinds of censorship, intimidation and terror.”Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, has not publicly commented on the events or the statement, which was released just before he left for a visit to the United States, where President Obama praised Indonesia as a great democracy.Mr. Joko, who took office in October 2014, is the first Indonesian president not to come from his country’s political elite or to have been an army general.Although he has proposed a national reconciliation process regarding the 1965-66 period and for other rights abuses committed during Mr. Suharto’s rule, he has not replied to calls by human rights activists to apologize to the victims and their survivors, who for decades after the purges were discriminated against and denied basic services such as education and health care.Mr. Oppenheimer, the American filmmaker and writer, called the recent events “an orchestrated plot” by elements within Indonesia’s security apparatus to intimidate the public into not questioning the official version of what happened in the mid-1960s, which has increasingly been dismissed as fraudulent by academics, the news media and younger Indonesians.He noted that while his second documentary on the period, “The Look of Silence,” was not blocked from being shown in Indonesia after its release in December 2014, paramilitary groups nonetheless threatened to attack any site showing it.“Now there is a president who is not from the military and is politically weak,” Mr. Oppenheimer said in a telephone interview. “I think the military and the ‘shadow state’ around them are exploiting Joko Widodo’s weakness to flex their muscles.”In Bali alone, an estimated 80,000 or more people were killed during the purges, according to a variety of estimates by academic researchers. And even 50 years on, talking about them remains problematic, as the Ubud festival’s foreign and Balinese organizers were well aware.“Obviously, it’s still a process, and people are still very sensitive about this issue, and I understand that,” said Ms. DeNeefe, the festival founder. “In Ubud itself, I don’t know how many people would feel comfortable speaking about it.”“It’s a big wound,” she said. “But on the flip side, there are other people who want to address this.”
