Without vigorous competition, there is little incentive for those companies to keep prices down and to make innovations.Government regulations can fill the gap. Figuring out what the rules should be was Mr. Tirole’s work, says our financial correspondent Binyamin Appelbaum.For communications, the idea was to force the company that owns a household cable line to sell access to competitors, setting a price that a competitor could afford and still make a reasonable profit.Europe, Australia and New Zealand are among the areas that apply those rules, which experts say result in better service and lower prices.“If the United States listened to Jean Tirole,” Mr. Appelbaum says, “people might spend a lot less time fuming about the poor service and high prices of cable and Internet providers.”Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.Your Morning Briefing is posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern.What would you like to see here?
