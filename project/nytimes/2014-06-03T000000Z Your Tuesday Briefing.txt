They gathered around a makeshift statue called the Goddess of Democracy.The government counted 241 dead and 7,000 wounded (including soldiers) that day; other estimates put the toll much higher.China has done much to suppress public memory of the events. An Internet search there for “Tiananmen” turns up “page not found.” The Tiananmen Mothers – a group of victims’ families – have been threatened and silenced. And activists live in fear or exile.Two books out today, “The People’s Republic of Amnesia” and “Tiananmen Exiles,” address that topic.Mention of the events of June 4 is banned in China. So the date is often referred to as May 35.Rick Rojas and Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.Your Morning Briefing is posted weekdays at 6 a.m.Don’t miss Your Evening Briefing at 5 p.m.What would you like to see here?
