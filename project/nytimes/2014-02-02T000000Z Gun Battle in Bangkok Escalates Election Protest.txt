BANGKOK —  At least six people were injured Saturday in a prolonged daylight gun battle between protesters seeking to block the distribution of ballots in Bangkok and would-be voters demanding that protesters cease their attempts to obstruct national elections on Sunday.After three months of a provocative campaign by protesters to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the clash on Saturday appeared to crystallize the power struggle that has been playing out on the streets of Bangkok.Ignoring pleas by the United States and the European Union to respect the democratic process — and stoking the anger of many Thais eager to vote — the protesters have blocked the distribution of ballots in parts of Bangkok and southern Thailand, a stronghold of the opposition.The shooting on Saturday raised fears about further violence as polls opened on Sunday. There were early indications that several hundred polling stations could not open because they lacked ballots or protesters had stopped voters from entering, The Associated Press reported.James Nachtwey, an American photojournalist who suffered a minor gunshot wound to his leg during Saturday’s clashes, said shooting was coming from both sides.Despite repeated claims by the protest leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, that his movement is fighting “without weapons,” photos and video images of the clashes showed protesters firing a variety of guns. “It was bullets flying in a very modern, contemporary part of the city,” Mr. Nachtwey said. Like the political violence of 2010 in the heart of cosmopolitan Bangkok, Mr. Nachtwey said, Saturday’s gunfight was “definitely incongruous.”Mr. Nachtwey said a bullet punctured his trousers but only grazed his shin.What began as a protest three months ago against a push by the governing Pheu Thai party to grant amnesty to its former leader has evolved into a full-blown effort by protesters and their wealthy backers to block elections that, by their own admission, they seem sure to lose.Although they represent a minority of the Thai population of 65 million people, the protesters number in the hundreds of thousands in Bangkok and say they are a vanguard of a social movement to reform Thailand’s democracy. To do so, however, they say they need to suspend democracy and place the country in the hands of an unelected “people’s council” while changes are made.The protesters oppose the dominance of the governing party and its de facto leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire tycoon who is Ms. Yingluck’s brother. (The amnesty bill would have benefited Mr. Thaksin, clearing what he says were politically motivated corruption charges and allowing him to return home from self-imposed exile.)The blockage of voting and the protesters’ overall skepticism of electoral democracy in Thailand has stirred anger in northern Thailand and other parts of the country where the governing party is strong.Protest leaders and their allies in the Democrat Party, which is boycotting the election, say they are confident the election will be nullified because the voting will be incomplete, mainly because their own obstructions have prevented candidates from registering in more than two dozen districts. Even if it is not nullified, the process is expected to drag on for months to allow those districts to stage votes and to give voters who were prevented from casting ballots in recent advance voting an opportunity to do so.Abhisit Vejjajiva, the leader of the Democrat Party, said Saturday that he would not vote Sunday because the election was “unconstitutional” and would not “achieve the aim of an election under a democratic system.”Critics of Mr. Abhisit, a former prime minister who has been charged with murder for a 2010 crackdown on pro-Thaksin demonstrators, say the party is boycotting the election because it is seeking to gain power by extra-constitutional means and relying on support within the county’s military establishment and elites.Somchai Srisuthiyakorn, an election commissioner whom the governing party accuses of siding with the protest movement, said on Thai television Saturday that local election officials had quit their posts in southern Thailand, making it likely that a number of stations there would be closed.“Anything can happen,” Mr. Somchai said.
