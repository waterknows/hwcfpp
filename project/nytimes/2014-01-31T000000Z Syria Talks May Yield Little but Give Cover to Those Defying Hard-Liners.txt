BEIRUT, Lebanon —  The images from spotless, quiet Geneva were striking — Syrian government and opposition figures sitting down together for the first time to discuss ending their country’s war — but inside war-torn Syria, patience wore thin as the talks dragged on with few results.Government supporters complained that the opposition delegation could not claim to represent all opponents, let alone all Syrians.Opposition activists groused that they would look weak if they failed to win concessions as the government continued bombarding and blockading rebellious areas.Yet as the first round of talks in the latest peace effort, known as Geneva 2, prepares to wrap up on Friday, there were signs that in small ways, the conference might have achieved one of its aims: to give political cover to those who want a solution but fear angering hard-liners on either side.In a striking development on Thursday, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, an organization operating under government auspices and widely accused of favoring pro-government areas, publicly declared a view that many of its volunteers had long quietly held: that humanitarian aid should be delivered in a politically neutral way, including to opposition-held areas the government has long blockaded.The group’s statement, posted on its Facebook page, came as the two sides in Geneva managed their first concrete displays of common ground, under pressure from Russia and the United States, countries backing opposite sides whose prestige would suffer if the conference ended with nothing.Both delegations, at the outset of morning talks, stood for a minute of silence to honor the tens of thousands of Syrians who have died in the war.It was a suggestion from the lead opposition negotiator, Hadi al-Bahra, but the government representatives did not, and politically could not, refuse.At the same time, a long-delayed aid convoy reached the blockaded Yarmouk Camp on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, where more than 18,000 Palestinian civilians are trapped and hungry. It delivered more than 1,000 food packages, each of which feeds a family for 10 days.It was a tiny fraction of what is needed, but the convoy was allowed to use a route that humanitarian agencies believe is safest, something the government had not allowed for the previous delivery, which was thwarted by gunfire.In another illustration of how civilians have suffered, a report issued by Human Rights Watch on Thursday said that the Syrian government had used explosives and bulldozers to demolish thousands of residential buildings to punish Syrians in neighborhoods where the army has clashed with opposition fighters.It used satellite imagery, witness statements and video and photographic evidence to document seven cases in which the government razed buildings from July 2012 to July 2013. Two of the areas are in Hama and five in or near Damascus.The total building area demolished is equivalent to about 200 soccer fields. Many were apartment blocks, some as high as eight stories, leading to the displacement of thousands of civilians, the report said.“Wiping entire neighborhoods off the map is not a legitimate tactic of war,” said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch.On its Facebook page, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent called for all parties to commit to “safe and unhindered access for aid and medical convoys to all places in Syria,” which will separate the “humanitarian file from the political file.”That meant defying some in the security forces who have declared that aid cannot be freely delivered to rebel-held areas because it will help insurgents, and countering a government proposal to instead allow women and children to leave blockaded areas.The opposition and its Western backers said the proposal violated humanitarian law, which gives civilians the right to receive aid without leaving their homes.The Red Crescent said the government proposal — which also required residents to list all male civilians and fighters — was “not the best solution,” since it left out some civilians, split families and “might lead to an escalation on the civilians left inside.”Asked why the newly bold statement came now, the group cited the Geneva talks, saying in a Twitter message that if aid was linked to politics, “Geneva 2 might not work for the best interest of people in need.”Syrian citizens, interviewed by phone or via Skype, said the talks should be given a chance, even on the subject that has deadlocked them: the call to form a transitional government “by mutual consent.” The core of the opposition says that means removing President Bashar al-Assad, while the government has said it will not negotiate his exit.Reem, a pro-government real estate agent in Damascus who provided only her given name to avoid repercussions, said she would accept power-sharing as a kind of “damage control,” and believed that government delegates would work for the common good, not for Mr. Assad’s interests.“I wouldn’t like someone from the coalition to be in my government, but we cannot deny that they have supporters on the ground,” said Reem, 29. “I don’t like it, but this is the best that can happen.”In a poll taken by a Facebook group for civilian opposition activists called Tahrir Souri, or Syrian Editors, more than half agreed with this description of Geneva 2: “It’s better than expected, and maybe we will get something out of it.”A rebel fighter reached in northern Syria was less diplomatic.“When I watch them talking in Geneva, I want to kill them all,” he said.Many saw the talks as a contest their side had won. Kevork Almassian, a television producer from Aleppo, in northern Syria, now living in Beirut, praised the government’s tough tone as “retaliation” against attempts by the United States to impose a solution. And Nawar, 45, a state employee and government supporter near Damascus, said his side should drag the talks out to “Geneva 20,” then elect Hafez Bashar al-Assad, the president’s young son, to succeed him.Abu Ibrahim, 50, a shopkeeper who lost his home to fighting and has brothers in the insurgency, said his disgust with the talks eased when he decided that the opposition would “win.”But Majid Sarsar, 25, a government supporter, said he wanted more flexibility from the opposition, including uniting with nonviolent government opponents and choosing a new government through internationally monitored elections.“I don’t deny that the Syrian regime is dictatorial in some ways — we are looking for more democracy,” he said. “In a peaceful way, not with war or guns.”
