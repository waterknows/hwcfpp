Pumpkins, at least, are native to North America.The Morning Briefing won’t be published on Thanksgiving, but we are back at 6 a.m. Eastern on Friday. Have a happy holiday.Victoria Shannon contributed reporting.What would you like to see here? Contact us at briefing@nytimes.com.Want to get the briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.
