LONDON — The 800th anniversary on Monday of Magna Carta, a medieval political truce that inspired protections for some of the world’s most cherished liberties, prompted a range of celebrations in Britain that included a ceremony involving Queen Elizabeth II and a national beer day.In Runnymede, England, the site 20 miles from London by the banks of the Thames where the document was signed, the queen and Prime Minister David Cameron attended an official commemoration, where Mr. Cameron noted the historical legacy of Magna Carta.“Liberty, justice, democracy, the rule of law — we hold these things dear,” he said, “and we should hold them even dearer for the fact that they took shape right here, on the banks of the Thames.”There have also been dozens of local events throughout the country, including seminars and talks, a Magna Carta musical, and plans for a national day to say “Cheers to Magna Carta” with beer, which has traditionally been Britain’s favorite alcoholic beverage. That was prompted by a call in the document for a standard measure for wine, ale and corn.The British artist Cornelia Parker is the mastermind of a more cerebral commemoration, with a work described as a response to Magna Carta from the digital era. An embroidery made by people including prisoners and lawyers, it replicates in stitch the Wikipedia article on the charter as it appeared on the document’s 799th anniversary, in 2014.Merchandisers also spotted an opportunity. The store at the British Library, which has two of the four surviving copies of the document, is selling a variety of commemorative products including a cushion, a necktie and a Magna Carta black currant jam.Magna Carta has been used to justify many different causes over the centuries, sometimes on shaky historical ground, but it has nevertheless evolved into a global symbol of the preservation of fundamental freedoms.Signed on June 15, 1215, Magna Carta put into writing a set of concessions won by rebellious barons from a recalcitrant King John — or Bad King John as he became known in folklore.By proscribing the power of the monarch, the document assumed an importance that grew over time, coming to represent the right to protection against arbitrary and unjust rule.That prompted mild controversy over the role of the queen in the ceremony on Monday. In an interview published in The Sunday Times of London, the historian David Starkey said he thought it was “a little absurd to commemorate the second greatest humiliation in the history of the monarchy by making the queen attend.”He also asked rhetorically whether, to honor the date of the execution of King Charles I, the country would create an executioner’s block and make the queen cut the ribbon.Though there have been many historical interpretations of the 800-year-old document, few dispute its influence.In the 18th century, for example, contemporary understanding of the document influenced the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights includes several provisions thought to descend from Magna Carta.Some modern-day critics of the British government worry that protections inspired by Magna Carta are at risk, as modern democracies increase the electronic surveillance of citizens to combat the threat of terrorism.Civil liberties campaigners also highlight the increased use of powers to deprive Britons of their citizenship if they are suspected of involvement in extremist activity, fighting or terrorist training overseas. Mr. Cameron has plans for a British bill of rights that would limit the reach of European laws on human rights.The Magna Carta anniversary also comes at a time of soul-searching and growing debate over Britain’s future.The referendum last year in which Scots rejected independence from the United Kingdom has not quelled Scottish nationalism or the debate about a possible breakup of the United Kingdom.Coincidentally, Britons are also commemorating this week the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo of 1815, a bloody encounter near Brussels that changed the course of European history. By the end of 2017, Britons will vote in a referendum on whether to leave the European Union.Despite the document’s fame, Britons have sometimes appeared a little fuzzy about it, Mr. Cameron included. He was unable to translate the term Magna Carta when asked to by David Letterman on his late-night talk show in 2012. (It is Latin for “Great Charter.”)That may explain the success of one of the best-known jokes of the comedian Tony Hancock, who asked: “Does Magna Carta mean nothing to you? Did she die in vain?”
