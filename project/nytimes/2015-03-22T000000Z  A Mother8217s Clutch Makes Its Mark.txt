Perspectives from a local and international standpoint distinguish the fifth annual New Voices in Black Cinema, running Thursday through next Sunday at BAMCinématek. The festival begins with the world premiere of “Knucklehead,” the writer-director Ben Bowman’s drama about a mentally disabled youth (Gbenga Akinnagbe, from “The Wire”) who struggles to survive life in Brooklyn public housing after the shooting of his brother and the predations of his abusive mother (a terrifying Alfre Woodard). Mr. Bowman and Mr. Akinnagbe field questions after the screening.Two extraordinary women are profiled in documentaries on Saturday: “Life’s Essentials With Ruby Dee” is a portrait of Ms. Dee, the actress-activist who died last year, by her grandson Muta’Ali Muhammad, and Joanna Lipper’s “The Supreme Price” examines the democracy movement in Nigeria as experienced by the feminist activist Hafsat Abiola. Watch, learn, be inspired. (BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; 718-636-4100, bam.org.)
