She will also address American’s destiny as a beacon for global freedom.”Ms. Rice, who is currently on the faculty at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, was the first female African-American to be secretary of state, from 2005-2009, and President George W. Bush’s national security adviser from 2001-2004.As national security adviser she championed the war in Iraq, arguing that the United States knew there were weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. She also played a role in the Bush administration’s policy on torture.At the State Department she backed a policy known as transformative democracy, arguing that the cause of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was rooted in oppressive governments.
