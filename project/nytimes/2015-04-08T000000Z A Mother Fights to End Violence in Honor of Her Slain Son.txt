On my second day in New York in August 2008, I wound up in Harlem after a wayward subway ride. I saw elderly people dancing in the street. I joined their dance and learned they were members of the Frederick E. Samuel Community Democratic Club so I decided to join the club. I attended its meetings and grew increasingly interested in the club’s discussions, as I come from Serbia, a country where democracy was relatively new.During one of the meetings, Jean Corbett-Parker told the story of a victim of gun violence, a young man shot by another youth. She urged the club to act. After she introduced herself as the mother of a murdered son and co-founder of Harlem Mothers SAVE, an organization that fights to end youth gun violence and helps other parents survive the pain of losing loved ones, I became determined to make a film. I admired her.Ms. Corbett-Parker showed me a documentary film made by her son Latraun about the harshness of growing up in Harlem and his search for his father. This developed into a dialogue about a mother and son, a relationship broken by the same violence still present. The dialogue grew into a documentary focusing on youth gun violence.The violence continued during the course of making the film, adding to the urgency of the project and the organization’s work. As I followed Ms. Corbett-Parker’s story and watched the people around her cope and persevere, the strength of this group of people and their commitment to their cause gave me courage.
