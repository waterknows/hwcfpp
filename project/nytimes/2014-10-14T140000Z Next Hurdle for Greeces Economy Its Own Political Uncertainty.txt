BRUSSELS —  Greece is not giving European leaders sleepless nights again, but as the eurozone’s problem child approaches the end of its second international bailout, political uncertainty in Athens is set to test the currency area’s resilience.The disclosure in late 2009 that Greece had cheated on its figures to conceal a huge budget deficit set off a rolling crisis that nearly tore apart Europe’s monetary union.Although there are timid signs that the Greek economy may have turned a corner after receiving 240 billion euros, or $304 billion at current exchange rates, in bailout funds, the political center may not hold much longer.Prime Minister Antonis Samaras won a vote of confidence from the Greek Parliament for his flagging right-left government on Friday, but political analysts say a snap election will probably be called for March that could propel the radical leftist Syriza party to power.It would be the first time a movement deeply hostile to a European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout program takes hold in Europe, sweeping aside center-left and center-right establishment parties tainted by having implemented harsh austerity measures.Syriza’s charismatic leader, Alexis Tsipras, says he would reverse some of those policies and demand that international lenders write off some of Greece’s giant €318.6 billion debt, 85 percent of which is owed to foreign governments and the I.M.F.Yet the radical leftists’ arrival in power would not unleash the same panic now that it would have in  June 2012, when Syriza appeared on the brink of a breakthrough.Early elections will be called if Mr. Samaras is unable to find 180 lawmakers to elect a new president in February. His coalition has 155 deputies, and none of the 23 independent deputies sided with him in the confidence vote.Trailing Syriza  in opinion polls, Mr. Samaras’s conservative New Democracy party hopes to cast off the stigma of intrusive supervision by the so-called troika of official creditors — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. — at the end of the year.Mr. Samaras is willing to forgo the last €12 billion of I.M.F. funds due in 2015-16 to escape quarterly review visits by the troika.Instead, he aims to borrow some of the money on the markets and is expected to tap a fund set aside for bank rescues.However, the I.M.F., the European Union and the paymaster Germany are eager to keep Athens under surveillance with a precautionary credit line as a safety net to underpin a return to market funding.Christine Lagarde, the head of the I.M.F., said recently that Greece’s outlook had improved considerably but that the country would be “in a better position” if it had precautionary support and a continuing relationship with her organization.Greece is set to run a primary budget surplus before interest payments for the second successive year in 2014 and is finally seeing a timid return of growth after six years of severe recession that shrank the economy by a quarter since 2008.But with unemployment still at more than 26 percent, and twice that level among young people, most Greeks have not felt any benefit from the feeble recovery so far. Anger and protests have turned to resignation, and in some cases to despair: The country has been scarred by a rash of public suicides at national landmarks.International lenders led by Germany are eager to help Mr. Samaras survive in government as long as possible to avert the risk of turbulence under a Syriza-led administration.If his coalition with the remains of the once mighty center-left Pasok party runs its full term, it could hang on until June 2016, by which time recovery might be more tangible for voters.But Berlin has put out discreet feelers to Mr. Tsipras in hopes of moderating the onetime firebrand if he does come to power.The German deputy labor minister, Jörg Asmussen, a former E.C.B. executive board member, has met with Mr. Tsipras at least three times, and the opposition leader has also met with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, and the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.Despite Mr. Tsipras’s demands, European Union officials insist that Greece does not need a debt write-off, which would be politically explosive in creditor countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.Private bondholders took major losses in 2012, so any additional debt relief would likely involve a further extension of repayment deadlines on official debt, the officials say.While the I.M.F. has to be repaid within 10 years, the average maturity on European loans to Athens is already 32 years, with a 10-year stay on interest payments at a rate of just 1.5 percent.Greece’s debt-servicing costs are lower now than before the crisis even though its debt mountain has swelled to 178 percent of national output — far above the 124 percent that the troika defined as a sustainable level by 2020.Miranda Xafa, an expert on Greek debt and a former member of the I.M.F.’s executive board, said Athens would need to raise €10 billion in the bond market next year, which may not be so easy if there is political uncertainty.That assumes it will be able to gain access to all of the €11 billion reserve in the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund set aside to recapitalize banks, depending on the outcome of the E.C.B.’s review of bank balance sheets to be published this month.“I don't think either the I.M.F. or the European Commission is likely to let Greece have a ‘clean exit’ like Ireland or Portugal,” Ms. Xafa said.Paul Taylor is a Reuters correspondent.
