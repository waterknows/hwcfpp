Here are the week’s top stories.1. The House was in disarray after the unexpected withdrawal of Kevin McCarthy from the race for speaker. The focus shifted to a reluctant Paul Ryan. But he may balk at what the conservative faction really wants: a rollback of the speaker’s centralized powers. One Republican said the goal is “a principles-based rather than a power-based structure.”_______2. Investigators hunted for motives in two more fatal campus shootings, at Northern Arizona and Texas Southern universities. “We’re going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place,” President Obama said on a visit to Roseburg, Ore., the week after a gunman killed nine at a rural community college there._______3. Two investigations concluded that a Cleveland police officer acted reasonably in deciding to shoot 12-year-old Tamir Rice last year, noting he did not know the boy’s age or that the gun he was playing with was fake. One, however, acknowledged that “Rice’s death was tragic and, indeed, when one considers his age, heartbreaking.” The findings came hours after hundreds of thousands massed for a “Justice or Else” rally in Washington against police killings._______4. The Nobel Peace Prize honored the one relative success from the Arab Spring uprisings — Tunisia — and lamented the many disappointments. In much of the Middle East, a Nobel official said: “The struggle for democracy and human rights has come to a standstill or suffered setbacks. Tunisia, however, has seen a democratic transition based on vibrant civil society, with demands for respect of basic human rights.”_______5. The Islamic State gained territory after Russian bombings in Syria that mainly targeted the group’s rivals, who are focused on ousting President Bashar al-Assad. President Obama seemed intent on maintaining his policy of “strategic patience and persistence,” which appears to mean waiting out Vladimir Putin’s moves._______6. Watch: Explosions struck a peace rally in the Turkish capital on Saturday, killing at least 95 people in what appeared to be deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s modern history. Those gathered were protesting the resumption of armed conflict between the Turkish state and Kurdish militants._______7. Palestinian protests and attacks escalated, raising concerns about a new uprising. Several Israelis and more than 20 Palestinians have died in the confrontations, some of which pit young women and children against Israeli security forces, and an Israeli strike in Gaza killed a pregnant Palestinian and her 2-year-old daughter._______8. Looking ahead: The first of six Democratic presidential debates comes Tuesday. Hillary Rodham Clinton brings a polished approach and her most serious rival, Bernie Sanders, a sense of conviction in a face-off with Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee that is expected to include sharp criticism of President Obama. Joe Biden appears to still be mulling a run. (CNN, 9 p.m. Eastern)_______9. There are 120 million households in the United States. But just 158 families are behind nearly half the donations in the 2016 race. The donors stand out against the country’s shifting demographics: They’re mostly white, older and male. And, of course, they’re rich: the $300,000 donated by one Chicago hedge fund millionaire is equivalent, relative to his income, to $21.17 for a typical family._______10. In division championships, the Chicago Cubs drew even with the St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Dodgers tied its series with the New York Mets. In the American League, the Houston Astros defeated the Kansas City Royals, 4-2, to take a 2-1 lead in their series, and the Toronto Blue Jays try to come back after two straight losses against the Texas Rangers. League championships begin at the end of the week, and the World Series starts on Oct. 27._______11. Columbus Day gives government, postal and many bank workers a holiday. But ethical concerns over the cultural devastation visited on the New World have eroded the day’s status, and most of us will be working on Monday. Stock markets are open._______12. Watch: North Korea celebrated the 70th anniversary of its ruling party with one of its largest military parades ever. The young leader, Kim Jong-un, in a rare public speech, spoke of his “love” for the people and said, “Our revolutionary armed forces are ready to fight any form of war the American imperialists want.” China’s leader sent a high official and a personal note, a sign of renewed warmth from the North’s only major ally.Have a great week.Video produced by Ainara Tiefenthäler.Your Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.Want to look back?
