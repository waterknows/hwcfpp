(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The president of the University of Missouri system resigned after faculty members joined student protests over racial tensions, and the chancellor followed suit. Over the weekend, the football team added powerful pressure, saying it would not play so long as President Timothy Wolfe, above, remained in place. “That would have been a disaster for their recruiting of black athletes and of black students to the university,” the U.S. representative for the area said._______2. Thousands of students gathered in the center of the university’s flagship campus broke into cheers after Mr. Wolfe stepped down, reveling in pride and a sense of power. “We won y’all!” tweeted a student who had been on a hunger strike. “It’s only one battle.....but we won.”_______3. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama met for the first time in more than a year, seeking to get past their rift over the nuclear deal with Iran. They said they were focusing on the renewal of a 10-year package of U.S. military assistance to Israel due to expire in two years._______4. Jubilation swept through much of Myanmar as the party of the democracy champion Daw Aung San Suu Kyi claimed a landslide victory in the country’s first free vote in decades. Results were still being tabulated. “I haven’t been able to eat anything since yesterday because I’m so happy,” one of her supporters said. “This is going to change everything in our country.”_______5. Ted Cruz’s father, Rafael Cruz, has captivated Republican audiences with his tale of fighting for freedom in the 1950s as part of Fidel Castro’s revolution, only to grow disillusioned by a government that became a repressive Communist dictatorship. But the heroic accounts are being disputed by Cuban contemporaries, former comrades and historians._______6. SeaWorld’s killer whale show will be taking final bows in San Diego. The company’s president said the decision stemmed from audiences’ changing tastes, not pressure after the release of “Blackfish,” a documentary criticizing how orcas are treated at the park. But shows at SeaWorld’s locations in Texas and Florida are to continue._______7. Mourners buried a 6-year-old Louisiana boy killed when police officers fired on his father’s car during a chase. The two officers were ordered held on bond of $1 million, but even the possibility of their release infuriated some. And it happened to be the day the Supreme Court ruled for a police officer who shot and killed a fleeing suspect from a highway overpass. A dissent said the ruling endorsed “a ‘shoot first, think later’ approach to policing.”_______8. Russian athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors and institutions were implicated in what could be the most extensive state-sponsored doping program since East Germany’s in the 1970s. “It’s worse than we thought,” said an official in the World Anti-Doping Agency, a co-author of the damning report, which urged lifetime bans for some athletes, including Mariya Savinova, a gold medalist in the 2012 Olympics._______9. The case of an accused mafia figure, Vincent Asaro (above, center, in 1996), went to the jury. Now 80, he has been on trial for three weeks over crimes including murder, robbery, extortion and one of the biggest cash robberies in U.S. history, the Lufthansa heist in 1978. Testimony has painted a portrait of the disappearing New York Mafia and its storied way of life._______10. A more current criminal world flared in an early-morning shooting in Midtown Manhattan. An altercation that began at a McDonald’s favored by clients of a nearby methadone clinic left one man dead and two wounded. The gunman was still being sought._______11. Good news: Peru has designated several million acres of the Amazon rain forest as parkland, creating a final link in a 67 million-acre Andes-Amazon Conservation Corridor._______Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to look back?
