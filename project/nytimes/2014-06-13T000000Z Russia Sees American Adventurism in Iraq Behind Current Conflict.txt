MOSCOW — Expressing alarm over the conflict in Iraq on Thursday, Russia said it had long predicted that American and British “adventurism” there would end badly.“We warned long ago that the adventurism the Americans and the British started there would not end well,” said Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, according to the Interfax news agency.Without referring to President George W. Bush by name, Mr. Lavrov said, “The situation in Iraq has been deteriorating at an exponential rate” ever since the American president declared a victory for democracy in Iraq 11 years ago.The Russian foreign minister accused the United States of withdrawing its forces prematurely for domestic political reasons, without finishing the task of preparing the Iraqi military to protect the whole country.Now, he said, Iraq is being overrun by terrorists and is at risk of breaking apart.“Iraq’s unity has been called into question,” Mr. Lavrov told reporters at a news conference. “Terrorism is rampant there because the occupation forces paid virtually no attention to the internal political processes, and didn’t facilitate national dialogue, but pursued their own interests exclusively.”Russia’s foreign ministry published a separate statement on its website Thursday from its spokesman, Alexander Lukashevich, echoing those remarks.The statement repeated that the “adventurism” of some Western nations led to the destabilization of Iraq.“There is not doubt that those who invaded Iraq over 10 years ago, and continued to impose their decisions and their will on the nations of the region, abetted the start of the destabilization process to a large extent,” said Mr. Lukashevich, adding that the results are now evident throughout the Middle East.The foreign ministry also strongly condemned attempts by the “terrorists” to consolidate their strength in Iraq, Syria and other unspecified parts of the Middle East.
