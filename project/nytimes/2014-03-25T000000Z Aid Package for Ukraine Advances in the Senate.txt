WASHINGTON —  The Senate voted on Monday to formally take up legislation to aid Ukraine and sanction Russia, beginning what promises to be a heated weeklong debate in Congress over the role the International Monetary Fund should play in the Crimean crisis.While the 78-17 vote showed considerable bipartisan support for the measure, bolstered by the votes of some Republicans who spent last week’s congressional recess in Ukraine, its ultimate fate is uncertain. Conservatives remain opposed to an overhaul of the monetary fund’s governance structure, which would expand Ukraine’s borrowing limit at the fund but, many Republicans say, would also diminish the United States’s authority and even increase Russia’s.And some senators made it known that they would use the debate this week to try to toughen the sanctions on Russia beyond those already imposed by President Obama.“Time is of the essence if we’re going to send a message to Russia,” said Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, who will try to attach an amendment expanding sanctions to Rosoboronexport, a Russian firm that handles the nation’s exports of military equipment. Mr. Coats specifically would block the government of Afghanistan from using United States military aid to buy Russian helicopters.Even with Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and its looming threats against Eastern Ukraine, the aid and sanctions package remains tangled in domestic politics. Influential conservative groups like Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, are urging lawmakers to oppose the inclusion of the monetary fund’s governance language, which they say would weaken United States authority and has nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis.“Any attempt to conflate the two issues is politically motivated; indeed, the Obama administration is misleading the American people to make these so-called reforms appear urgent,” Heritage Action charged on Monday.Republican leadership is not digging in ideologically against the fund’s language, but Republicans want something in return, namely at least a delay in the Internal Revenue Service’s regulations of political groups operating as tax-exempt “social welfare” organizations.That, in turn, fed directly into the Democrats’ continuing attacks on Charles and David Koch, the conservative billionaires who are spending millions of dollars to defeat Senate Democrats in the 2014 elections.“Republicans objected to moving forward with this aid package unless Democrats agreed to allow the Kochs and billionaires like them to continue to anonymously spend millions trying to buy America’s democracy,” Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Monday. “It’s hard to believe, but that’s the truth.”The Senate legislation would guarantee $1 billion in loans to the shaky, fledgling government in Kiev and offer an additional $100 million in direct aid. It would also offer $50 million to strengthen democratic institutions, to improve the rule of law and civic organizations, and to help the Ukraine government recover assets stolen by the deposed Ukrainian government. It would codify sanctions against Ukrainian and Russian individuals already hit by sanctions ordered by Mr. Obama, but at the same time it would expand the list of targets who would be denied United States visas and subject to civil or criminal penalties.The fund’s language, sought sporadically by the Obama administration since Mr. Obama helped negotiate the changes in 2010, would expand loan limits for Ukraine and other countries aided by the fund. It would expand the authority of emerging economies like Russia, China and Brazil, but the United States would retain its veto authority at the fund.Republicans such as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming hope to use the Senate floor debate to add language expediting the export of United States liquefied natural gas to undermine Russia’s energy stranglehold on Eastern Europe.The House already passed a Ukraine aid package, without that fund language and without sanctions on Russia. Under criticism from Senate Republicans, the House is likely to pass legislation this week similar to the Senate’s except it would again exclude the fund’s language.That could set up a House-Senate showdown as soon as this weekend, Senate aides said.Senators from both parties, more than a half-dozen of whom just returned from Ukraine, urged the Senate to move quickly and the House to follow.“The I.M.F. reforms are not the reason why this legislation is before us. The reason it’s before us is Vladimir Putin has absorbed Crimea into Russia,” said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
