As my colleague Dan Levin reported from Beijing, the authorities in China appeared to step up their censorship of the Internet to blot out even oblique discussion of the 25th anniversary of the violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 3 and 4, 1989.This year that effort seems to have included making Google’s services largely inaccessible, blocking its search engines and other products, including Gmail and machine translation services.While the more obvious social networks are routinely filtered for mentions of the date of the crackdown, usually rendered as 6/4/89, the virtual silence around the events has been pierced in previous years by Chinese activists who have found novel ways to evoke the past using such apparently apolitical Internet services as Foursquare.That tradition of looking for innovative ways to smuggle remembrance into Tiananmen Square for the anniversary seems to have inspired one anonymous photographer to snap an image that noted the date through a hand of cards, arranged to hint at both the date and a type of weapon carried by Chinese soldiers that day, the AK-47 assault rifle.The image — snapped behind the back of a police officer and in front of the flag that is raised above the square each day from a distinctive podium — was uploaded to Sina Weibo, the Chinese microblogging site, before being deleted late last week. The image has also been posted on Facebook and Google Plus, where it was shared and debated by several thousand Chinese users able to evade the Great Firewall.A sense of just how successful China has been in minimizing awareness of the crackdown was captured in a report for NPR this week by Louisa Lim. She showed 100 university students the iconic image of an opponent of the crackdown confronting a line of tanks near the square on June 5, 1989. Only 15 of them, she reported, seemed to know that the photograph had been taken in their capital city in 1989.Ms. Lim, the author of a new book called “The People’s Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited,” told my colleague Ian Johnson that the students were perhaps not just uninformed but also uninterested in this moment in history. “These were kids at Beijing’s top universities who possessed the skills to bypass the Great Firewall if they wished to,” she said. “Yet if they were doing so, they clearly weren’t looking up information about 1989.”She added, “While the Internet clearly has a huge impact breaking down the government’s monopoly over information, if there is no appetite for information about politics and the past, then there isn’t even much of a need for censorship.”
