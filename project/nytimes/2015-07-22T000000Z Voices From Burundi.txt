Few voters apparently went to the polls in Burundi on Tuesday in a presidential election that is widely expected to give President Pierre Nkurunziza a controversial third term.Since his announcement on April 25 that he would run again, in defiance of international pressure and opposition at home, Burundians have held protests, edured curfews, experienced a local news media blackout and witnessed a failed coup attempt.Nearly 70 people have died and hundreds have been injured, and more than 170,000 people have fled since April to neighboring countries.Before the vote Tuesday, and prior to legislative elections in June, The New York Times asked Burundians how the upheaval has affected them. Following is a selection of experiences, edited and condensed for clarity.Merlo Lokaze, 25, thought he would never participate in any form of political protest. But when he heard the president’s decision to run for a third term, tears started streaming down his face.Jean Mugisha, a 40-year-old teacher living in Bujumbura, says that the governing party still has his support and that the turmoil, which he calls a “show,” is just a “play by the opposition” to weaken the government. Ketty Nivyabandi, 36, a poet, led an all-female street movement in the capital, Bujumbura, after Mr. Nkurunziza announced his plans to run for a third term.
