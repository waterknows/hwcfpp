President Obama once criticized the flow of money to political action committees, calling it a threat to democracy.But after conceding to political reality and accepting a “super PAC” that supported his re-election in 2012, the president completed his turnabout on Tuesday by attending a fund-raiser for the Senate Majority PAC, which raises money for Democrats in Senate races.It was the first time that Mr. Obama had attended a super PAC fund-raiser, and his presence reflected the urgency of raising money to defend the Democratic majority in the Senate this fall.White House officials said the president was participating in a “round table” event and was not directly engaged in soliciting money. Ty Matsdorf, a spokesman for the PAC, declined to give any details on the fund-raiser itself.But the careful language used by the White House and Democrats did not shield Mr. Obama from the expected criticism. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Obama was being hypocritical.“After railing against outside money, President Barack Obama will now raise money so Senate Majority PAC can fling mud against Republicans,” Mr. Wilcox said. “It’s just further proof that Democrats will do anything to stay in power.”Mr. Obama gave his tacit blessing in February 2012 to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that supported his re-election. He sent top administration and campaign officials to appear at the group’s events but indicated that he would not personally do so.Aides to Mr. Obama said at the time that the president’s position was born of necessity, given that he would be facing a well-financed Republican opponent who would benefit from just the sort of groups that the president had previously denounced.“Democrats can’t be unilaterally disarmed,” Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said in an interview at the time.
