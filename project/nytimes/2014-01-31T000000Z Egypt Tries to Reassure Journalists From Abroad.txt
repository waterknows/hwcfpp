CAIRO —  The government on Thursday tried to reassure foreign correspondents that they are free to report in Egypt after prosecutors filed criminal charges accusing 20 journalists for Al Jazeera television of conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood.Advocates for the freedom of the press expressed alarm about the Al Jazeera case because the charges appear to turn on judgments about the content of what the journalists reported along with their possession of documents from the Muslim Brotherhood, the recently outlawed Islamist movement that had backed President Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted in July.In a statement on Wednesday, prosecutors said that they were charging the journalists with broadcasting false reports of civil strife in Egypt in order to aid the Muslim Brotherhood in destabilizing national security. The defendants could face years in prison if convicted.Sherif Mansour, the Middle East program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, called the charges an “attempt to criminalize legitimate journalistic work.”Foreign correspondents in Egypt have raised concerns that publishing or broadcasting an interview with a representative of the Muslim Brotherhood might be prosecuted as a crime, for example, for presenting false news, undermining national security or promoting the ideas of a terrorist group.In a statement on Thursday, the State Information Service said Egypt welcomed foreign correspondents to cover even “constructive criticism” of the government, in accordance with its commitments to democracy, freedom of expression and transparent elections.Alluding to journalists’ fears about being charged for interviewing members of the Brotherhood, the statement said that “mere contact” with any “accused criminal” is not a crime under Egyptian law.The statement, however, contained caveats. It said that Egyptian law does not protect freedom of “thought and opinion” if it develops into action that violates Egyptian laws, like “crimes that threaten the country’s national security.”The statement also said that contact with an “accused criminal” may be a punishable offense “if this contact is a sort of assisting or inciting.”The Al Jazeera case has raised special alarms among foreign correspondents in Egypt because at least two of those charged — Mohamed Fahmy, an Egyptian-Canadian who previously worked for CNN, and Peter Greste, an Australian who previously worked for the BBC — are established journalists with extensive experience at Western news organizations. Both have been detained in Egypt since they were arrested in late December in a hotel suite where they had been working.
