The liberal-leaning chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Shirley S. Abrahamson, filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking to keep her position, a day after voters approved a constitutional amendment likely to result in her demotion.The constitutional change ends Wisconsin’s practice of installing the longest-tenured Supreme Court member as chief justice and could exacerbate the tensions between the court’s liberal and conservative blocs. The change, approved by voters by a six-point margin, calls for the seven justices to choose a leader every two years, and the court’s four-member conservative majority is widely expected to pick one of its own.Chief Justice Abrahamson named her six Supreme Court colleagues as defendants in the lawsuit, as well as Wisconsin’s secretary of administration, secretary of state and treasurer. In the suit, she argues that the amendment should not take effect until her term ends in 2019.“The speculation that this somehow shortens her tenure, she felt was wrong,” said her lawyer, Robert S. Peck.The amendment attracted outside spending in the buildup to Tuesday’s election, with supportive conservatives purchasing advertisements that said the change would be a boon for democracy. Liberals said the amendment was a poorly disguised act of partisanship targeting Chief Justice Abrahamson, who has drawn conservatives’ ire in recent years as the court considered a series of politically charged cases.Chief Justice Abrahamson, 81, also requested a temporary restraining order, which would block a vote for a new chief while her suit is pending. She has served on the Supreme Court since 1976 and became chief justice in 1996. In 2009, voters re-elected her for another 10-year term.The lawsuit received a swift rebuke on Wednesday from Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business group, which supported the amendment.“The due process she claims is being denied her was the election,” Scott Manley, a group vice president, said in an email, “but the voters sent a message yesterday that the chief justice position is not an entitlement.”
