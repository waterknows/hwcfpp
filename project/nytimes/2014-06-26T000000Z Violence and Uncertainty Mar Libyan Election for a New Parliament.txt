TRIPOLI, Libya — With their expectations battered, Libyans headed to the polls on Wednesday to elect members of a new Parliament, in a vote seen as a critical step in a democratic transition that was overshadowed by an intensifying civil conflict in the eastern part of the country.On a sweltering day in the capital, empty polling stations and quiet streets provided a sharp contrast to the rapturous parliamentary vote two years ago, the first national election after the fall of Libya’s longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Election officials said that the number of voters who registered for Wednesday’s election was roughly half that of the last parliamentary vote, leaving poll workers to wonder whether the World Cup might be distracting the electorate.Instead, voters cited growing disillusionment with the country’s post-revolt leaders, saying they had failed to deliver on promises to deliver security or to properly manage the country’s considerable wealth. The complaints echoed misgivings with the Arab uprisings across the region, where impatience with democratic turmoil has allowed a retrenchment of strongmen and authoritarian order.News late Wednesday that one of Libya’s most prominent human rights activists had been assassinated in her home in Benghazi — shortly after she had voted — crystallized a feeling that the country was succumbing to dark forces.“We’re like another Iraq,” said Nasser Amin, a taxi driver who sat in a Tripoli cafe with friends, who, like him, had not bothered to vote. “Things have gone from bad to worse,” he said. “We need someone with a sword.”Even among voters who called it a national duty to cast ballots and bolster Libya’s democracy, uncertainty marred the day. Many voters spoke of a fear that they would repeat mistakes from the last parliamentary election, which delivered a transitional legislature that proved more adept at squabbling than solving the country’s many crises.Yet Libya’s relentless violence cast the longest shadow over the integrity of the election. The eastern city of Benghazi, Libya’s second largest, has been torn by weeks of fighting between Islamist militias and forces loyal to a renegade general, Khalifa Hifter.In May, General Hifter, seizing on public anger at Libya’s armed groups, announced a campaign to purge the country of Islamist lawmakers and militias, sending troops and even warplanes to move against militia bases. On Wednesday, the fighting flared despite assurances by the combatants that there would be a cease-fire for the vote; at least three people were killed and more than 30 wounded, according to a hospital.Later on Wednesday, Salwa Bugaighis, a lawyer and human rights activist, was killed by unknown assailants who stabbed and shot her in her home, according to officials and local news media. Ms. Bugaighis, an early participant in the 2011 uprising against Colonel Qaddafi, fought against the marginalization of women in the post-revolt order and was a vocal critic of Islamists who became increasingly assertive after the fall of the dictatorship.In another eastern city, Derna, regarded as a stronghold of jihadists, polling stations were closed over fears that militants would try to intimidate voters, according to residents.If the vote cannot be repeated, “then we have a serious problem, because the city is not represented, and that’s injustice,” said a local lawmaker, Mansour al-Hasadi.The election commission said that voting stations were also closed in the southern city of Sebha because of security concerns, and that eight polling stations in a town west of Tripoli were closed after being attacked by gunmen. Elsewhere, the election was held peacefully and without any immediate allegations of fraud or other irregularities. More than 630,000 people, or roughly 42 percent of voters, cast ballots, the election commission said.The election was held to replace the General National Congress, the transitional legislature seated in 2012, with a 200-member body that will be called the House of Representatives. The new legislature is supposed to be based in Benghazi, rather than Tripoli, in what is partly an attempt to soothe longstanding complaints of marginalization in eastern Libya.Some hoped that the election might refresh the country’s politics, dispersing some of the poison that surrounded the General National Congress while restoring the kind of faith in the government that could marginalize militias or a rising strongman like General Hifter.“The election is a safety raft for the political process,” said Mohamed Ali Abdullah, a lawmaker who said that members of his party had decided not to run in the latest election in an acknowledgment of public dissatisfaction with the legislature.“The will of Libyans is being tested,” Mr. Abdullah said. “How badly do we want democracy?”Some of the old Parliament’s biggest detractors — who dismissed it as dominated by Islamists from the Muslim Brotherhood who had focused on their own narrow concerns — were among the first to show up at the polls Wednesday.“I was looking for someone who was not Brotherhood,” said Ahmed al-Miskhal, who could not even recall the first name of the candidate he had just voted for as he left a polling station in the Tripoli neighborhood of Fashloom. His only reason for showing up to vote, he said, was to ensure that Islamists did not participate in the Parliament.“They are not working for the good of Libya,” he added.Abdulrahim Ibrahim Yaacoubi, a contractor, peered at a list of candidates in another polling station for several minutes, the consequences of his choice clearly weighing on him.“We made a lot of mistakes” during the last parliamentary vote, he explained, saying voters had chosen candidates — teachers, religious leaders and even extremists — who had turned out to be ineffective politicians.Mr. Yaacoubi he said he saw the vote as a chance to save the troubled country from the fate of other nations, including Syria, consumed by a civil war, and Egypt, where the military had seized power from the elected president.“The most important thing is honesty,” he said of the candidates he was considering. “We’re still better than most.”
