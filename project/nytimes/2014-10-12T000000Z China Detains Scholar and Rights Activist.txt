BEIJING —  A Chinese scholar and rights advocate who founded an influential nongovernmental think tank has been detained on the criminal charge of provoking troubles.The Beijing-based lawyer Li Jin confirmed Sunday that the scholar, her client Guo Yushan, was detained by the Beijing police last week.Mr. Guo is the latest of dozens of people who have been detained as Hong Kong wages a pro-democracy protest to demand universal suffrage in elections for the top official of the semiautonomous territory.Ms. Li says she has yet to meet with Mr. Guo, and it was not immediately clear on what basis the police charged him.Mr. Guo is a co-founder of the Transition Institute to research China’s social and economic issues, but Beijing’s authorities, citing lack of proper registration, shut down the group last year.
