It is a badge of civic pride, the sartorial equivalent of a lollipop at the end of a visit to the doctor: the “I Voted!” sticker, a diminutive yet celebrated way to boast about one’s contribution to democracy.The privilege of wearing a post-voting sticker, however, does not extend to the residents of New York City, where the local Board of Elections does not hand them out.This has not gone down well with the citizenry.“When we were out working on the last election, a lot of people said, ‘Well, where’s the sticker?' ” recalled Amy M. Loprest, executive director of the city Campaign Finance Board. “People want this sticker.”And so the people shall get it. Starting on Primary Day in September, the Campaign Finance Board will distribute thousands of “NYC Votes” stickers around the five boroughs. And in the interest of keeping things democratic, the board is asking the voters to create the design.Starting now, New Yorkers can submit their sticker ideas online. The deadline for entry is July 28; finalists will be chosen and public votes will determine the winner.“Government agencies are not generally known for being fun,” Ms. Loprest said. “But we’re trying to do something fun.”There are a few rules. The stickers must be small. They must include an official “NYC Votes” logo, a cube-like emblem in a spectrum of colors. And, per the contest instructions, the stickers must convey an entirely nonpartisan message.Well, almost nonpartisan. The stickers must also be biased in favor of voting, so anarchists and pranksters are encouraged to stay away.Entries will be judged on their aesthetic and civic worth. “It’s not teeny tiny, but it’s small, so you really need to have something that pops and expresses the message quickly and simply,” Ms. Loprest said.The winning designer receives a prize: a pair of tickets to a coming mayoral debate. Transportation, hotel and dinner are not included.
