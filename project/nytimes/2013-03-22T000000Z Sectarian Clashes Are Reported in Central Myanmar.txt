BANGKOK — At least five people have been killed in fighting between Buddhists and Muslims in central Myanmar, residents and a hospital official said Thursday, in another sign of a resurgence of communal violence that is testing the country’s fledgling democracy.Buddhists, including monks from nearby monasteries, led a rampage through the Muslim quarter of the city of Meiktila on Thursday seeking to avenge the death of a monk the day before, according to a news photographer who witnessed the fighting.“The area was like a killing field,” said the photographer, Wunna Naing. “Even the police told me that they could not handle what they witnessed. Children were among the victims.”Muslims and Buddhists have clashed several times in western Myanmar over the past year, but the fighting in Meiktila has raised fears that religious strife is reaching into the heartland of the country.News agency photographs showed gruesome scenes of devastation in at least a small area of the city, with homes burned to the ground, thick black clouds rising above a mosque that residents say was attacked, and a charred corpse.Daw Mae Yee, an official at Meiktila General Hospital, said at least five people had died from burns and slash wounds, and Reuters reported that another employee of the hospital said the dead included Muslims and Buddhists. U Win Htein, a member of Parliament from Meiktila, said that rioting was “still out of control” on Thursday afternoon, and that the death toll was probably significantly higher.The clashes on Wednesday appeared to have started with a disagreement in a gold shop owned by a Muslim family.Religious violence has shaken the government of President Thein Sein over the past year as the gradual rollback of five decades of authoritarian rule has coincided with a rise in nationalism and racial and religious hatred.Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is about 90 percent Buddhist, with the rest of the population Christian, Muslim and animist.More than 150 people, most of them Muslims, have been killed since June in Buddhist-Muslim clashes in Rakhine State, a sliver of land in western Myanmar where religious hatred runs high. Some vocal Buddhist monks have been stridently anti-Muslim after those communal clashes, which pitted Buddhists against a group of Muslims who call themselves Rohingya and are not recognized as citizens of the country.Until this week, there were hopes that religious conflicts would be contained to that region. But the clashes in Meiktila are renewing concerns that religious strife will surface in other cities in Myanmar, which are typically multiethnic, a legacy of British colonial rule.There have been signs of rising tensions. Last month in a township on the outskirts of Yangon, the commercial capital, Buddhists attacked what they said was a mosque being built without permission.Meiktila, a garrison city with a strong military presence, is halfway between the new capital, Naypyidaw, and the old royal city of Mandalay. Reports from residents indicated that the military units based in the city had not yet joined the police in helping to quell the violence.The police in Meiktila, reached by telephone, declined to comment on the violence.Two mosques and a Muslim school were burned, residents said, and many houses in the Muslim quarter were destroyed.The authorities declared a curfew on Thursday for the second consecutive night.
