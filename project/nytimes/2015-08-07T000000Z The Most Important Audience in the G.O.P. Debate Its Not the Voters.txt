There are four audiences for the G.O.P. debate Thursday night — voters, donors, party leaders, media members — and they are not equal in importance.It is tempting to view a presidential debate, even at this nominating stage, as an exercise in democracy. In 2012, several million people tuned in to watch early primary debates like the one tonight — and this debate may garner even more attention. Voters, however, are tonight’s least important audience because it is too early and there are too many candidates. This makes it hard for voters to coordinate around one or two based only on what happens tonight.But it is not too early for the news media, the party elite and donors to use tonight’s candidate performances to coordinate their behavior. The power to decide who emerges ahead of the pack is in the hands of the three other players in the event.The fact that the media, party elites and donors have power to shape the field cannot be disputed. Depending on your point of view, this is either a good or bad thing. This scorecard will help you keep track of where each candidate stands with these groups as the primaries roll on.Although each group is important to candidates’ fortunes, they each trade in their own currency. It is hard for candidates to survive the months of travel and campaigning without money, making the importance of donors obvious.The party’s leaders also carry tremendous sway — since 1980, the single best predictor of a party’s nominee is the number of endorsements from party elites in the months before primaries begin. And in 2012, it became clear that when candidates’ share of media coverage grew and the tone of their coverage became increasingly positive, a direct bounce in poll numbers resulted.Many voters may tune in the debate tonight, but they are not the most important audience watching it.
