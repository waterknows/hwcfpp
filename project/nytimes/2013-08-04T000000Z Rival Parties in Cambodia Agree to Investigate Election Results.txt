PHNOM PENH, Cambodia —  The two rival parties claiming victory in Cambodia’s general election reached an agreement on Saturday with the state National Election Committee for a joint investigation of polling irregularities, but one side’s commitment soon appeared to waver.Tep Nytha, the election committee secretary general, had announced the agreement in principle after meeting with senior members of the governing Cambodian People’s Party and the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party. Later in the day, the opposition party said it was not ready to attend a session on Sunday to organize the investigating committee.In an e-mailed statement, the Cambodia National Rescue Party repeated its desire for representatives from the United Nations and civil society to be members of the committee, rather than just observers, as Mr. Tep Nytha said would be the case. The committee, which is widely seen as biased in favor of the Cambodian People’s Party — or at least unwilling to challenge it — would also be part of the investigating body.Prime Minister Hun Sen, in power for 28 years, has made clear that he believes the final results of the July 28 election, due in mid-August, will favor him and that he will have another five-year term in office. With his overpowering influence over the state apparatus and the judiciary, he is almost certain to have his way.While the establishment of the investigative body is unlikely to have any substantive effect, it could still benefit both parties.If the body agrees that there were flaws in the election process, it could initiate changes for which the opposition could take credit, keeping its promise of fighting a long-haul struggle for democracy.Mr. Hun Sen, for his part, could stake a claim of being willing to compromise, giving the appearance of being reasonable rather than an intransigent autocrat. The gesture might appease foreign critics like the United States, which strongly called for such an investigation.
