MALE, Maldives — The president of the Maldives declared a state of emergency on Wednesday that sharply curtails citizens’ rights for 30 days following an explosion on his speedboat and the discoveries of a homemade bomb near his residence and a weapons cache.Attorney General Mohamed Anil said President Abdulla Yameen made the decision to safeguard public safety.“The military and police found weapons and an explosive from two locations in their operations,” Mr. Anil said. “Because these would be a threat to the public and the nation, the National Security Council has advised to take immediate steps to protect the people of Maldives.”Under the state of emergency, the military and police are allowed to enter and search homes without warrants and can make arrests virtually at will. Citizens are forbidden to hold protests or labor strikes or to travel between the country’s many islands.Foreign Minister Dunya Maumoon said that the measures were “pre-emptive and precautionary” and that airports, transport hubs and tourist resorts are all safe.“The security of our resorts and islands is not under threat and we have received no evidence to suggest otherwise,” she said in a statement.The declaration effectively thwarts plans by the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party to hold a mass rally on Friday in the capital, Male, to demand the release of its jailed leader, former President Mohamed Nasheed.In a statement, the party called for Mr. Yameen’s resignation, saying he has lost control of the country.“His paranoid regime lurches from crisis to crisis,” said a party spokesman, Hamid Abdul Ghafoor.Abbas Faiz, Amnesty International’s Maldives researcher, said that the emergency declaration was surprising and that the government had not given a clear justification for its move.“This must not be an excuse to violate human rights and to silence critics and opponents,” he said.The Maldives has been tense since a Sept. 28 blast on the president’s speedboat and a subsequent series of arrests, including that of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, on suspicion of involvement in the explosion.Mr. Yameen was unhurt by the blast, which the government called an assassination attempt.The Maldives, known for luxury island resorts and beaches, has had a difficult transition to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008, which ended 30 years of autocratic rule by Mr. Yameen’s half-brother.
