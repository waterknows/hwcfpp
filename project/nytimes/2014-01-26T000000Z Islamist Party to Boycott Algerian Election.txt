ALGIERS, Algeria —  Algeria’s largest Islamist political party announced it will boycott April’s presidential election, citing fears of fraud.The statement Saturday said a majority of the ruling council of the party, the Movement of Society for Peace, voted not to participate in the April 17 election because “conditions weren’t right for a free choice for Algerians.”The party’s decision represents a break from its history of always participating in elections. On Friday, the liberal Rally for Culture and Democracy party announced its own election boycott for similar reasons.Algerians are waiting to see if President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who is ailing, will run for a fourth term despite having had a stroke last year. A number of people have already announced their intention to run for the presidency, but few are seen as serious candidates.
