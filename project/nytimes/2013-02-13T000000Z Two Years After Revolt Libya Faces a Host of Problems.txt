PARIS — Nearly two years after a revolt that ousted and killed the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya’s weak government is struggling to control its borders, stop the smuggling of weapons and manage regional militias that have refused to disarm, according to the conclusions of an international meeting on Libyan security here on Tuesday.Countries that supported the Libyan rebels came to the conference at the Foreign Ministry to show their support and concern, especially after continuing violence from militant groups around Benghazi, where the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans were killed in September, and amid evidence that the several dozen militants who attacked an Algerian natural gas plant last month came from Libya.The British foreign secretary, William Hague, emphasized the problem of border security. The Algerian gas plant is jointly run by BP; Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company; and Statoil of Norway, and at least 4 of the 37 foreign workers killed were from Britain, which is among the countries that have offered to provide training to the security forces of the central government.“It is important of course that Libya is able to secure its borders,” Mr. Hague told reporters, “that it is able to make sure that there aren’t ungoverned spaces, particularly in the south of Libya, that militias can be demobilized.”The Libyan foreign minister, Mohamed Abdelaziz, acknowledged that significant problems remained in Libya, but he rejected the idea of foreign forces helping to control the borders. He said that a European Union training force would help, but that Libya would continue to focus on integrating former fighters into a regular security force. “Democracy will not be instituted by the Libyans alone,” Mr. Abdelaziz said at a news conference.He later told Reuters that he had received pledges from France, Britain, Turkey and other countries to provide technical support and equipment, but that more needed to be done to secure his country’s frontier.Libya announced on Monday that it would shut its borders entirely with Tunisia and Egypt around Sunday’s anniversary of the Libyan revolution for security reasons. The ban will run from midnight on Thursday through Saturday.The NATO forces that aided Libya’s rebels have been criticized for not doing more to help seal Libya’s borders, though Westerners argue that Libya’s government has regularly refused to allow significant numbers of foreign forces to operate inside the country. But Colonel Qaddafi was a lavish purchaser of weapons, and unknown amounts of them have been smuggled out of Libya to the surrounding region — including Egypt, Gaza, Syria and Mali.Islamist militants who were approaching the capital of Mali, prompting a quick French military intervention a month ago, were largely armed with weapons from Libyan stockpiles, and some Libyan trucks with large weapons mounted on the back were recently seen in Gaza, apparently smuggled through tunnels from Egypt. Rebels fighting the Syrian government have also had access to Libyan weapons.The attack by militants on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi last September remains a hot topic in Washington, with key Republican senators pressing the Obama administration to explain more of what happened in the period before the death of Ambassador Stevens.
