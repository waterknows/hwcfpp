Supporters of Lebanon’s “You Stink” protest movement — who were confronted with water cannon and tear gas over the weekend when they took to the streets to demand a solution to the trash crisis in Beirut — ridiculed the authorities online Monday for trying to stifle dissent by erecting a concrete blast wall around the seat of government.

            We have our very own Berlin Wall now.        Activists and journalists reported that, within hours, the new “Beirut Wall” was covered in antigovernment graffiti and provided a focal point for protesters who rallied after dark to denounce the use of force by the police.
