HONG KONG —  An unofficial referendum on making the selection of Hong Kong’s chief executive more democratic has attracted votes equal to more than a fifth of the city’s electorate, organizers said Sunday, the referendum’s final day. They voiced hopes that the higher-than-anticipated participation would, along with a protest march scheduled for Tuesday, increase the pressure on the mainland Chinese government to give ground on the issue.The results released Monday showed that an overwhelming majority of participants wants Hong Kong’s Legislative Council to reject any electoral reform proposal from the government that does not meet the international standards demanded by pro-democratic groups.Democracy advocates organized the 10-day vote as a political battering ram, seeking to force Hong Kong politicians and Chinese Communist Party officials to heed demands that the election of the chief executive, the city’s top leader, be opened to greater public participation with fewer procedural barriers set in place by Beijing.The poll attracted valid votes from more than 787,000 Hong Kong residents, who used a cellphone app, a website or polling booths to choose among three proposals, according to an email from the university polling unit that oversaw the vote.The vote lacked the safeguards of an official vote, but the number was equal to 22.4 percent of Hong Kong’s 3.51 million registered voters. In the last election for the Legislative Council, in 2012, about half the registered voters cast ballots. Benny Tai, a legal scholar who has led the referendum effort, said he was encouraged, although the final tally may go down once double votes — people voting twice on phone apps and the website — are weeded out.“That is a figure much higher than anyone could have expected, including us and the government,” said Mr. Tai, an associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong who is a leader of Occupy Central with Love and Peace, the group that started the referendum.“I think we’re seeing some signs that the Chinese government understands that the civil referendum, even though unofficial, is an expression of public opinion that needs to be considered seriously,” Mr. Tai said in an interview.China has promised to allow voting changes for Hong Kong so that from 2017, the chief executive is chosen through universal suffrage, a step provided for in the basic legal framework for the city. But democracy activists believe the changes could preserve Beijing’s power to engineer the outcome it wants.The Occupy organizers have said that if electoral changes fall short of genuine universal suffrage, they will hold protests in Central, a district dense with banks and other businesses.The most popular electoral reform proposal attracted 42.1 percent of the votes. Like the other two proposals, it allows a candidate to win a place on the ballot for chief executive by gaining endorsement from 1 percent of registered voters. As well, 87.8 percent of those who participated said the Legislative Council should veto any electoral plan that “cannot satisfy international standards.”The council has 70 members, and the “pan-democrat” camp holds 27 seats, enough to veto any changes to the voting laws, which require support from two-thirds of members.The Chinese government has repeatedly condemned Occupy Central and dismissed the referendum as illegal.After the vote closed, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government said that a core demand in all three proposals — allowing voters to nominate candidates directly through write-ins or similar grass-roots initiatives, without seeking the nod of a nominating committee — was unlikely to ever win official backing.The Hong Kong government “has reiterated many times before that it is unlikely to be adopted in view of the controversies relating to the legal, political and operational aspects of the proposal,” the unidentified spokesman said in a statement issued on the Hong Kong government’s website.Michael Tien, a pro-establishment member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, said Monday in an interview that the referendum would have to garner far more votes for the central government in Beijing to consider changing its stance on how the chief executive is nominated.“If instead of 700,000 it is three or four million, then I think China would completely reassess the situation,” said Mr. Tien, a leader of the New People’s Party.Tensions have been rising in Hong Kong over the electoral issue and many residents worry that the Chinese Communist Party leadership is seeking to shrink the city’s autonomy, established under a “one country, two systems” policy agreed upon before the British colony returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.The next gauge of discontent with government policies in Hong Kong will come on Tuesday, the anniversary of the city’s return to China, and a day every year when democratic groups and other critics of Beijing rally.“We have to wait for the turnout on the first of July,” Mr. Tai said. “If we have a very high turnout, that again will confirm the message to Beijing that Hong Kong people are really determined to have true democracy.”He said that this year, the organizers of the July 1 march hoped to see attendance rivaling the 2003 march, when hundreds of thousands of people joined in.The discontent reflected in the referendum could eventually help induce quiet concessions from Beijing, said Joseph Wong Wing-ping, a former senior public servant in Hong Kong who has backed the Occupy Central movement. “At the end of the day, whether they are prepared to soften up a bit is of course a political judgment, which I don’t think anyone could arrive at yet,” Mr. Wong said in an interview. “But openly you will not hear any soft remarks from the central government.”
