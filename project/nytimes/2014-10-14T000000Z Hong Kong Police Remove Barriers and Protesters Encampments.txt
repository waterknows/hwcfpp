HONG KONG — Hundreds of police officers moved into downtown Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, pushing back pro-democracy protesters who overnight had erected barricades around their main street camp after a day of deepening contention that brought thousands onto the streets. Bankers, builders, engineers and smartly dressed office workers were among the surge of people who gathered deep into Monday night to keep the police from squeezing the student-led protests out of the three major areas of the city they have clogged for two weeks.“This is to protect our democracy, to protect our future,” said Patrick Chan, an accountant, taking a brief break from helping to raise an elaborate fortress of bamboo and plastic binding on the edge of Central, the city’s main financial district.“The government doesn’t listen to the Hong Kong people, so we must do this,” he said, his voice choked with emotion.On Tuesday morning, several hundred police in helmets and protective gear ran back onto Queensway, the road where the protesters had erected new barriers overnight, and began forcing the crowd onto side streets, holding up warnings that the area was cordoned off.Crowds of protesters stood close by, yelling curses at the police, while workers began dismantling the barriers.Actions by the police and threats from opponents of the protests have repeatedly backfired, making the pro-democracy demonstrators more determined to hold fast. Two weeks ago, when the police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to break up the demonstrations, even more people went out into the streets in solidarity. This time, police attempts to pare back the protesters’ barricades have prompted supporters to build more, using bamboo poles, garbage cans, concrete, bus stop signs and even large potted plants and carpet scavenged from office renovations.“Before, the street barriers were just symbolic, but the ones going up now are something else,” said Jo Wu, an office worker who went out into Queensway, a major shopping thoroughfare, to express support for the protesters, while also walking her pet pug, Mimi. “People are showing their distrust of the government.”Like Ms. Wu, many people who turned out on Monday evening to help or to cheer on the barricade builders were middle class, expressing anger with the government over disappointed hopes for greater home rule.“We came to show our support for something we really treasure: democracy,” said Steven Tsui, a financial analyst in his 20s who works in the financial district and was still dressed in a dark business suit. “We need to show that this is not only students who are angry.”Thousands of people sat on the pavement of Harcourt Road on Monday night, listening to speeches and music, while thousands more milled about the hundreds of tents that have sprung up on the avenue. One was Nelson Lee, 26, who works in the insurance and fund management industry.“They came for the same reason: They disagree with people destroying the barriers by improper means,” Mr. Lee said, adding that he had helped erect some barriers last week. “Students just want democracy, and the government uses so many means to destroy the protests.”The police effort to remove some barricades in the Admiralty and Central areas of the city began before dawn on Monday, taking sleeping protesters by surprise. The police cleared at least one important downtown artery but left the protest camp untouched.Later in the day, hundreds of people who oppose the pro-democracy demonstrations tore down more of the barricades around Admiralty that have choked traffic in the city, including two made largely of metal scaffolding at either end of Queensway. The crowds appeared to include truck and taxi drivers and members of “triads,” the local organized crime gangs, according to supporters of the protesters, but a good number were ordinary residents.Lucy Tse, 52, said she had been stuck in her home in east Hong Kong Island since the protests broke out two weeks ago, and she lamented that she had to take the train instead of getting around in her Mercedes-Benz. “This is a public space for all Hong Kong people, not just for the students, not just for the government,” she said. “These Hong Kong students are spoiled.”Those seeking to demolish the barricades even used a crane to pull apart a barrier near the Pacific Place shopping mall, until the police arrived and tried to ease tensions.Hui Chun-tak, the chief police spokesman, urged people on both sides to stay calm, but he signaled that the barricades would not be allowed to remain indefinitely, and that the police were prepared to take some down themselves.Supporters of the pro-democracy protests regained the upper hand on Monday evening. At Mong Kok, on the other side of Victoria Harbor, volunteers used crates and bamboo poles to reinforce their barriers.Hong Kong police equipped with heavy steel shears began cutting plastic ties and dismantling barricades on Tuesday morning in one of the city’s busiest shopping areas, Causeway Bay, but there was little sign of resistance or arrests. “This is not clearing the site; please leave for your own safety,” officers said through loudspeakers.The swift police operation appeared to be undertaken with little physical force against protesters, although at least one man was thrown to the ground. A group of supporters of the protesting students stood on a hillock overlooking the street, and some of them chanted “gangsters” in Cantonese, while the police dragged away tents that had been used by the demonstrators guarding the barriers.A police spokesman said some barricades needed to be removed because they had been enlarged overnight and made heavier with the use of cement: “If there are ill or injured people, an ambulance might not be able to get through.”Many Hong Kong residents see the Chinese government’s rejection of democracy for their city as an affront to their values, and feel that the special status they have had since Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 is under threat.The Chinese government has promised to let Hong Kong voters choose the city’s leader, called the chief executive, starting in 2017. But rather than allow open nominations, the government has insisted that candidates be screened by a committee dominated by people loyal to Beijing.Surveys have indicated that managers, professionals and educators are among the Hong Kong residents who are most dissatisfied with their municipal government. And while only a minority has actively supported the protests, that support remains robust.By late morning, the police had cleared Queensway and the protesters had left or retreated to their main camp nearby. But some saw another round of contention coming. Chan Yenyen, a 25-year-old schoolteacher who has been protesting for more than two weeks, sat at the foot of two rows of police.“I’m angry that they’re removing the barricades, we will just put them back,” she said. “I was scared the first week, but now I’m so tired I can’t even be scared.”
