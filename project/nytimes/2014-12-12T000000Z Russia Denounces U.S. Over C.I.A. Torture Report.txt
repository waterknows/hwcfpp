MOSCOW — Often castigated by the United States over its record on human rights, democracy and civil liberties, Russia on Thursday seized on the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the use of torture by the C.I.A. to turn the tables on Washington and demand that those responsible be brought to justice.The Russian government, in a statement posted on the Foreign Ministry’s website, said the report provided “confirmation of gross, systemic human rights violations by the American authorities.”The statement, issued by Konstantin Dolgov, the ministry’s commissioner for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, called the disclosures in the report “shocking” and complained that only the executive summary had been released, while the bulk “remains classified, and the American authorities still do not wish to disclose it.”“We are urging the human rights community and responsible international organizations and structures to seek from Washington the disclosure of the full spectrum of information about human rights abuses committed in the framework of this ‘global war on terror’ and to bring those guilty to justice,” Mr. Dolgov said in the statement.Russia also called for an investigation into the role of other governments that allowed the C.I.A. to operate secret prisons on their soil, saying they appeared to be complicit in the “crimes” detailed in the report.The Kremlin has no small motivation to snicker over the uncomfortable position of the United States, given the incessant criticism that it has faced over the years regarding limitations on democracy and the rule of law in Russia.That criticism has come not only from the United States, but also from the United Nations, which in 2012 issued a scathing report accusing Russia of violating an international treaty prohibiting torture.In 2010, the United States adopted a law known as the Magnitsky Act, aimed at punishing Russian officials and citizens who had allegedly violated human rights. Although they may not have been convicted of any crime, Russians on the so-called Magnitsky list are barred from traveling to the United States and from maintaining any financial assets, real estate or other property there.The statute is named for Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in prison after trying to expose a huge tax fraud said to have been carried out by government officials. In retaliation for the American human rights statute, the Russian government banned the adoption of Russian orphans by American citizens.Despite the smirking in Moscow, the Russian government when accused of wrongdoing has not permitted the sort of comprehensive inquiry carried out by Democratic staff members of the Intelligence Committee.The report on torture was also accompanied by a forceful rebuttal from Republican members of the Intelligence Committee, an example of the vigorous public political discourse that is rare, if not unheard-of, in the Russian legislature.On the contrary, in recent years, some of the few opposition voices in the State Duma, the lower chamber of Parliament, have been expelled by their colleagues on dubious grounds or have had to face accusations of treason for criticizing the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.Russia has repeatedly been accused by numerous international organizations of trampling on human rights, including charges of mistreating migrant workers and state-approved discrimination against gay men and lesbians.In the Foreign Ministry statement on Thursday, Mr. Dolgov said it was the United States that was guilty of hypocrisy by holding itself up as the global standard-bearer of democracy and human rights, and he noted that the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, remained in operation.“This gloomy picture of history hasn’t been closed yet,” Mr. Dolgov said. “This situation does not fit with the claims of the United States for the title of ‘model of democracy.’ This is far from reality.”
