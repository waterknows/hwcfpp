More than ever, tension among forces of cosmopolitan democracy, religious traditionalism and militaristic order roil the Middle East. So Asia Society’s “Iran Modern,” an exhibition of more than 100 artworks made in Iran in the two decades before the revolution of 1979, should be something to see. Modern art was starting to thrive then, as artists explored new possibilities of identity. It opens Friday. (Through Jan. 5, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, asiasociety.org.)Identity has been an enduring theme for Eleanor Antin, whose conceptually provocative, often humorous works of the 1970s and ’80s will be surveyed in “Multiple Occupancy: Eleanor Antin’s ‘Selves’ ” opening Wednesday at Columbia University’s Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery. She has said, “I consider the usual aids to self-definition — sex, age, talent, time and space — as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice.” Accordingly, she has inhabited a variety of identities in her performances, videos, photographs, films and installations. (Through Dec. 7, 1190 Amsterdam Avenue, near 116th Street, Morningside Heights, columbia.edu.)
