BEIRUT, Lebanon —  Members of Lebanon’s Parliament voted by a large margin on Wednesday to extend their own terms in office by more than two and a half years, asserting that the country’s tenuous security situation made it too difficult to hold elections.This was the second time the lawmakers voted to keep themselves in office since being elected to four-year terms in 2009. Foreign diplomats, human rights organizations and many Lebanese citizens denounced the move as undermining democratic practices in a region dominated by strongmen and monarchs.Lebanon’s political system relies on deals struck between its many political parties and religious sects — and often their foreign backers — in order to function. But consensus has been rare as powerful blocs have lined up behind opposing sides in the civil war in neighboring Syria, and gridlock has paralyzed the system.Last year, the same lawmakers voted to extend their terms for some of the same reasons they cited on Wednesday.After 11 months, the prime minister finally formed a cabinet in February, but the body has done little since. Political wrangling has also kept the country without a president since May.Randa Slim, a director at the Middle East Institute in Washington who studies Lebanon, said that at least the country’s power brokers had agreed to keep the peace — no small feat in a country where a lengthy civil war still resonates.Unfortunately, she said, Lebanon’s politicians agree on little else and often avoid the political deal making necessary to get things done.“In the name of preserving the civil peace, they feel that they can get away without doing any of the hard work of governing,” Ms. Slim said.Of Parliament’s 128 members, 95 voted for the extension on Wednesday and two against. Some parties boycotted the vote.Walid Sukariyeh, a member of Parliament who supported the measure, cited two reasons: the lack of a new electoral law to govern the vote, and instability in the country.“Doing elections in this security situation is not safe,” he said.Alain Aoun, a member who boycotted the vote, called it “a dark spot on the history of Lebanese politics and democracy.”Protesters who opposed the extension tried to block access to the Parliament building, hurling eggs and tomatoes at lawmakers’ cars and calling them names. But for most, the day was unremarkable because many Lebanese expect little from their politicians.David Hale, the United States ambassador to Lebanon, said in a statement released after the vote that he was deeply concerned about the “paralysis of Lebanon’s political institutions” and called for new elections as soon as possible.
