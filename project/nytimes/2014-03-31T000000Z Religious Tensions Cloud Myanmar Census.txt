YANGON, Myanmar —  Census workers fanned out across Myanmar on Sunday to begin a nationwide count of the country’s population, an exercise that has been widely criticized for stoking religious and ethnic tensions because the government has denied members of a long-persecuted Muslim minority the right to identify themselves as Rohingya.In addition, administrators in some parts of the country — including rebel-controlled areas in the states of Kachin and Wa — said they were barring census takers because they were worried that the census would be used for political purposes.Ethnic minorities, which together make up about 40 percent of Myanmar’s population, contend that they were not properly consulted ahead of the census, which requires respondents to identify themselves as one of 135 ethnic groups.Khaing Khaing Soe, director of the Department of Population, was undeterred by rebel threats to deny access to census workers.“We will go to every corner of the country and will conduct the census according to international standards,” she said. “We will not exclude any area.”She also said that anyone who tried to stand in the way of the census workers would be punished.Myanmar only recently emerged from a half-century of military rule and self-imposed isolation. No one knows how many people live in the country, which is predominantly Buddhist. The most-accepted estimate, 60 million, is based on extrapolations from the last count in 1983, which experts say was hugely flawed, leaving out many religious and ethnic minorities.More than 100,000 census workers, most of them schoolteachers wearing white blouses and khaki waistcoats, started going door to door at 7 a.m. on Sunday.They hope to reach 12 million households by the time they finish their job on April 10.Their long, complicated survey — a collaboration between the government and the United Nations Population Fund — seeks information well beyond the number of people living in each home, however, like literacy and employment levels, disabilities, access to clean water, and fertility and mortality rates.It also includes highly controversial questions about race and ethnicity that human rights groups have repeatedly warned are especially inappropriate at this delicate juncture in the country’s transition to democracy.They are especially worried about Rohingya Muslims in the western state of Rakhine, who have been the targets of attacks by Buddhist mobs in the past two years that have left up to 280 people dead and forced 240,000 to flee their homes nationwide.Tens of thousands are living in apartheid-like conditions in crowded camps, where they have little or no access to jobs, education or medical care.The government considers members of the religious minority to be illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh, though many arrived generations ago, and refers to them only as “Bengalis.” Though numbering around 1.3 million, they are denied citizenship by national law.Worried that the census would legitimize the Rohingya’s status, Buddhists in Rakhine State have protested and threatened to boycott it. With tensions soaring, some Buddhists have in recent days attacked the homes and offices of foreign aid workers who have been helping Muslims, forcing the evacuation of almost all the staff members of the groups.On Saturday, Ye Htut, the presidential spokesman, announced that Rohingya would not be allowed to identify themselves as such on the ballot.“If a household wants to identify themselves as ‘Rohingya,’ we will not register it,” he told reporters after meeting with President Thein Sein and members of the country’s political parties, adding that people could call themselves “Bengali.” The British Embassy protested, saying that under international standards, respondents had the right to answer as they saw fit.
