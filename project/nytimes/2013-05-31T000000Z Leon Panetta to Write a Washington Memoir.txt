Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has struck a deal to write a memoir of his life and career, his publisher said on Thursday.The Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Group USA that has published books by Zadie Smith, Kofi Annan and Ron Chernow, among others, acquired the memoir.“I have seen Washington at its best and at its worst,” Mr. Panetta said in a statement. “My goal is to give readers the opportunity to go behind the scenes and learn the lessons of how our democracy works, and sometimes how it fails to work.”A publishing executive familiar with the negotiations said the book drew an advance of close to $3 million. Ann Godoff, the president and editor in chief of Penguin Press, declined to comment on size of the advance.Mr. Panetta was represented by Tina Bennett and Jennifer Rudolph Walsh of the William Morris Endeavor agency.No title or publication date has been set.Mr. Panetta, a native of Monterey, Calif., has spent most of his career in public service, including as a first lieutenant in the Army, and later as member of the House of Representatives. Under President Bill Clinton, he was chief budget adviser and a chief of staff.In the Obama administration, he was the director of the C.I.A. and then secretary of defense. After stepping down as defense secretary in February, he returned to the Panetta Institute, a public policy organization that he co-founded in 1998.
