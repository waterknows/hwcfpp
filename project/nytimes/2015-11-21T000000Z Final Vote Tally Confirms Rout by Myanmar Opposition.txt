BANGKOK — Myanmar’s election commission on Friday announced the final tally of the country’s Nov. 8 landmark election, a rout by the opposition, led by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.Her party, the National League for Democracy, won 390 seats compared with 42 for the governing party, a state-run television station reported in its Friday evening broadcast. The remaining 59 available seats in Parliament were won by smaller parties. One-quarter of the seats were not contested and are controlled by the military.The victory gives Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party a large majority in Parliament and the right to select a new president early next year.Both the president and the head of the military have congratulated Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi on her party’s performance. But they have also given mixed signals about the timing of the transfer of power, which, according to the Constitution, must be carried out by March. The governing Union Solidarity and Development Party has said it will follow up on complaints of irregularities, a process that could take months.
