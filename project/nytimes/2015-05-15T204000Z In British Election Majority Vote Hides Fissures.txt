LONDON —  After all the talk of coalitions and constructs, odd bedfellows and shotgun alliances, Britain seemed to revert to its political default: a single party, in this case the Conservatives, providing a majority government, as they did under John Major and Margaret Thatcher, and now with David Cameron.But no one awakening to the redrawn topography after the elections of May 7 could avoid the jarring new reality, expressed chromatically in the mapping of the outcome, which showed dominance divided by geography — yellow, denoting the insurgent Scottish National Party, with 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats, and blue, signifying the Conservatives’ 331-seat share, yielding a slender majority in the national legislature.Britain, said Brian Taylor, a BBC reporter in Scotland, had become “two nations divided by a common Parliament.”But there was a deeper imbalance, not so much in the political math as in the hearts of those who created it.Whatever the spin and shadings of victory — the Conservatives’ counterintuitive promise of a centrist workers’ paradise, the Scottish National Party’s sudden coyness about the timetable for Scottish independence — the fissures run deeper, not least over the way those disparate visions are expressed at the ballot box.Before the vote, there was earnest musing about how politicians would gauge the legitimacy of alliances  projected as the most likely successor to Mr. Cameron’s five-year coalition with the Liberal Democrats.But in the aftermath, for some of the losers at least, there was just as much grumbling about the fairness of Britain’s “first past the post” system, which awards membership of the 650-member Parliament exclusively on the basis of candidates’ tallies in individual constituencies rather than on any broader vote total.Thus, this month,  1.454 million ballots in Scotland gave the pro-independence Scottish National Party nearly all the Scottish seats, inspiring  Alex Salmond, a former head of the party, to liken the result to a lion roaring across the land. But those ballots, representing just half the vote in Scotland, accounted for only 4.7 percent of all votes cast in Britain — less than the 5 percent threshold for membership in Parliament  common in many Continental European nations.By contrast, in more diffuse voting, the right-wing U.K. Independence Party secured 3.88 million votes but garnered just one seat, even though it had the third biggest slice, 12.6 percent, of the popular vote. The smaller Greens won 1.157 million to keep their single seat. The leaders of both parties failed to win election, but neither of them, in the end, quit in disgrace, in contrast to their Labour and Liberal Democrat counterparts. Lions may have been roaring in Scotland. South of the border, some squeaked foul.And yet, most paradoxically, many Britons like it that way. In 2011, a proposal for electoral change was defeated in a referendum by a ratio of 2 to 1. Coalitions and consensus do not sit easy with the bulldog spirit, it is sometimes argued; the big parties prefer to take, not share, the spoils.Thus, at a time when Britain faces challenges in its relationship with Scotland and Europe — potentially interlinked crises of identity — its leaders have only the narrowest of majorities in Parliament to impose their writ, their mandate approved by just over a third of the voters.Of course, no electoral outcome is going to please everyone. “Democracy isn’t a restaurant where every diner gets to order a la carte,” the columnist James Kirkup wrote in the conservative Daily Telegraph.That calculation, though, was easier in a more deferential era, before Britain’s doffed cap gave way to 21st-century entitlement and assertiveness.Democracy, Mr. Kirkup wrote, resembles a quarrelsome family where “one meal gets cooked for everyone: no one gets exactly what they want and everyone is a bit unhappy but eats it anyway.”He might have added that, in this new sharp-elbowed scrum for the smorgasbord, table manners will be the last thing on anyone’s mind.
