The first sign that the Republican Party’s 17 presidential candidates might have trouble explaining what a conservative foreign policy should look like — beyond simply saying that it should not look like Barack Obama’s — emerged on May 10. That’s when the Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Jeb Bush a rather predictable question about the Iraq war: ‘‘Knowing what we know now, would you have authorized the invasion?’’Bush said yes. Shortly after that, he said that he had misheard the question; later, that the question was hypothetical and thus unworthy of an answer; and finally, upon further review, that he in fact would not have authorized the invasion. The jittery about-face suggested that Bush had spent little, if any, time digesting the lessons of the war that defines his older brother’s presidency.The shadow that George W. Bush’s foreign policy casts over Jeb Bush’s quest for the White House is particularly prominent. But it also looms over the entire G.O.P. field, reminding the candidates that though Republican voters reject what they see as Obama’s timid foreign policy, the public has only so much appetite for bellicosity after more than a decade spent entangled in the Middle East. At some point, even the most conservative of voters will demand an answer to the logical corollary of Megyn Kelly’s question: How does a president project American strength while avoiding another Iraq?Among the many advisers recruited to help Jeb Bush answer that question is Richard Fontaine, the president of the Center for a New American Security, a policy group based in Washington. Fontaine was a senior foreign-­policy adviser for Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, where he first learned that winning over voters was a radically different task from those he navigated during his career in the Bush administration. ‘‘Diplomacy is about minimizing differences,’’ he told me. ‘‘ ‘Pol Pot and the Pope — surely there’s something they can agree on.’ A political campaign is exactly the opposite. It’s about taking a minor difference and blowing it up into something transcendent.’’Watching Jeb Bush flub the Iraq question confirmed a theory about that war and its unheeded lessons that Fontaine had been nurturing for several months. In February, he co-wrote an essay in Politico Magazine arguing that Congress should not authorize Obama to use military force against ISIS until it had done the kind of due diligence that Congress utterly failed to do before authorizing Bush to invade Iraq in 2002. In response to the essay, Fontaine said, many of his peers acknowledged to him ‘‘that there actually hasn’t been a lot of thinking on this from the entire foreign-policy establishment other than the knee-jerk ‘Well, we’re never gonna do that again.’ ’’Fontaine, who is 40, Clark Kentish in appearance and wryly self-deprecating in conversation, has been doing quite a bit of thinking on the matter of Iraq. He worked in the State Department as well as the National Security Council during the first year of the Iraq war before signing on as McCain’s foreign-policy aide in 2004. Over the next five years, he and McCain traveled to Iraq 10 times. His boss had been one of the loudest advocates of toppling Saddam Hussein and then one of the most candidly chagrined observers when the war effort began to crumble before his eyes. ‘‘We’d been running this experiment from 2003 to the end of 2006 of trying to make political changes in Iraq and hoping this would positively influence the security,’’ Fontaine recalled. ‘‘It only got worse and worse. Things got to the point where there was no political or economic activity in the country, because the violence was so bad.’’The troop surge in 2007 succeeded in stabilizing the country. By then, however, Americans were weary of military aggression. In 2008, they elected president a one-term U.S. senator who had consistently opposed the war in Iraq and vowed to end it so he could devote most of his attention to a foundering economy. Four years later, the electorate awarded Obama a second term, with the same priorities in mind. Exit polls showed that 60 percent of voters regarded the economy as the predominant issue in 2012, while a mere 4 percent cited foreign affairs as their chief voting issue.Three years later, this has changed — especially for Republican voters, who, according to several polls, now say national security rivals the economy as a foremost concern. Several factors explain this. While the economy has continued to improve, the Obama administration has watched with seeming helplessness as ISIS dominates swaths of Iraq and Syria while beheading American hostages; as Iran threatens to make good on its nuclear ambitions unless the United States agrees to lift sanctions; as Vladimir Putin reasserts Russian primacy by invading the Crimean Peninsula; and as China spreads its influence across Asia and Africa. These and other developments have revived concerns that the United States has become dangerously weaker under a Democratic president, one whose first secretary of state happens to be the apparent favorite for that party’s presidential nomination.The swaggering rhetoric of Donald Trump, the current Republican front-runner, seems deftly calibrated to reflect the mood of a G.O.P. base spoiling for fights abroad. According to a Quinnipiac University poll in July, 72 percent of registered Iowa Republican voters (where the first contest for presidential delegates will be held early next year) favor sending American ground troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS. In August, Quinnipiac found that 86 percent of all Republicans opposed the Iran nuclear deal.Fontaine is among the conservative foreign-policy thinkers who argue that the Obama administration has overlearned Iraq’s lessons. ‘‘Their core belief was ‘We’re here to wind these wars down, and the risks in doing so are manageable,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘The instinct was to limit our investment, whether diplomatically or in terms of blood and treasure. That’s caused a willful disregard for the realities at hand. You hear it all the time: ‘This is the Iraqis’ fight,’ or ‘The Syrians should be fighting.’ Yes, they should. But if they’re not, then we have a national interest, and we should be doing something.’’Eventually, each G.O.P. candidate will be called upon to define exactly what that ‘‘something’’ is and determine whether Americans have an appetite for it. To that end, for the next 14 months, it will fall to advisers like Fontaine to help the candidates craft a post-Bush/post-Obama foreign-policy vision, one that simultaneously projects more muscle than Obama and less reckless use of muscle than Bush. The tricky part, as their advisers — avowed hawks whose careers were shaped by Iraq — know all too well, will be to demonstrate that an aggressive foreign policy can somehow avoid becoming a reckless one.In the weeks and months following the announcement of a presidential candidacy, the ‘‘invisible primary’’ ensues: a wooing and hoarding of assorted campaign specialists and policy experts to convince the donor community that the candidate in question is for real and lacks only money to make the whole operation hum. During this season, men and women who have lived lives of bookish reserve and who are thoroughly unknown to the general public become, for a brief time, objects of considerable desire.As a national-security expert who worked with politicians but had no political agenda of his own, Fontaine received multiple inquiries. He declined to work with the campaigns of Scott Walker and Marco Rubio but agreed to join the Bush foreign-policy team after Bill Simon, a former Wal-Mart chief executive and now the Bush campaign’s policy-team recruiter, asked him to come aboard as an informal outside adviser. Simon had heard about Fontaine through other recruits, including the former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who had been a consultant for several campaigns before Bush prevailed upon him to pledge his fidelity.Zoellick and Fontaine belong to a nomadic tribe of worldly Republican technocrats who migrate from academia to government to nonprofit policy centers to the private sector. Nearly all are hawks who abhor not only Obama’s posture of caution but also the old-style, consensus-building internationalism espoused by officials who served in the first Bush administration, like Richard Burt and Lorne Craner, who are now on Rand Paul’s foreign-policy team. Among the conservative intelligentsia, a few — Meghan O’Sullivan, Kristen Silverberg and Elbridge Colby — are comparatively moderate alumni of the second Bush administration who now advise his brother’s campaign. Others have made their names on the Hill as forceful interventionists: Robert S. Karem, who advised the House majority leaders Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy before directing Jeb Bush’s foreign-policy team; Jamie Fly, formerly Rubio’s aide in the Senate and now in his campaign; and Michael Gallagher, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member who now runs Scott Walker’s foreign-policy shop. In addition, advisers like Vance Serchuk, who was Senator Joe Lieberman’s foreign-policy aide and now works in a geopolitical-strategy unit for the global investment firm KKR, and Christian Brose, the staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, are not committed to a particular campaign but are routinely called by campaign aides for their thoughts on foreign policy. What most of them have in common is that they are under 45 and have been influenced far more by the fall of the twin towers than by the collapse of the Berlin Wall.The candidates are pulled toward experience as well, creating an odd dissonance within these teams as they are taking shape. For example, Jeb Bush’s team includes not just a new generation of foreign-policy thinkers but also Paul Wolfowitz, a prominent 71-year-old neoconservative. Wolfowitz’s long career in the national-security arena reached both its peak and its nadir when he served as George W. Bush’s deputy secretary of defense and pushed aggressively for the invasion of Iraq just after 9/11, assuring skeptics that the Iraqis would ‘‘welcome us as liberators’’ and that the indigenous oil revenues would largely finance the country’s reconstruction. In no small measure because of Wolfowitz’s erroneous predictions, the neocon brand came to be ridiculed during the early stages of the Iraq war, only to be vindicated somewhat by the triumph of the 2007 troop surge, which quelled Sunni violence and stabilized the Shia-dominated government.Throughout that period, not every hawk self-identified as a neocon, including Fontaine, who told me, ‘‘Where I come down on this is I believe in the promotion of human rights and democracy, but there are times when you have to have pragmatic relationships with autocracies.’’ And today there are fewer still who call themselves neocons, the moniker being generally viewed as an epithet. Its basic principles, however — among them, a belief in the aggressive promotion of American values throughout the world, an unapologetic distrust of international institutions and the conviction that a more democratic world is a less belligerent one — are abiding specters in conservative foreign-policy thought.The persistence of a chesty, exceptionalist view of America’s place on the world stage is, of course, also abetted by today’s nuance-free zone of political dialogue. ‘‘The discourse in Washington just becomes like a self-licking ice cream cone of maximalist foreign policy,’’ Obama’s deputy national-security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told me. ‘‘That’s what gets you on television. That’s what gets your think-tank paper read.’’But conservative voters far from the Beltway are also clamoring for a return to a more muscular foreign policy, and there is almost certainly one major reason for this: It would be very different from the current foreign policy. Obama’s worldview, seven years into his presidency, is aptly reflected by something else that Rhodes said to me: ‘‘There’s such an extreme vanity that everything happening in the world is an extension of our agency. There are just forces happening. They’re happening all across the Middle East. And our narrative of what’s supposed to happen in these places has never been right, because they’re at different stages of development and have different politics. And where we succeed in foreign policy is when we patiently and methodically incentivize better behavior, and you give space for that to occur. It’s very hard to completely impose a system on a country. The last time it worked was in postwar Japan.’’When I shared Rhodes’s sentiment with Jim Talent, one of Scott Walker’s foreign-policy advisers, he winced before replying: ‘‘Obama doesn’t accept as a basic principle that we should lead in the forefront of events, particularly in the Middle East. I’m not sure the president believes the U.S. can do that. And there I disagree. We can’t control the world. No way. But we do have influence. If you want to call me a neocon for that, go ahead.’’Talent, a placid-faced 58-year-old Midwesterner, was a congressman from St. Louis when he won a special election to the U.S. Senate in 2002 with heavy backing from President Bush, whose desire for congressional authorization to invade Iraq Talent heartily endorsed. By 2006, when Talent was up for re-election, the war had taken a disastrous turn. Talent nonetheless insisted that ‘‘the mission is going well’’ and further declared that the invasion was justified even when no weapons of mass destruction were found. He lost to Claire McCaskill and has been out of electoral politics ever since.A second career soon awaited him — that of national-security guru. While serving on congressionally established advisory commissions, Talent also became a national-security adviser to Mitt Romney’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. It was commonly speculated that a President Romney would tap Talent to be his secretary of defense. Today the same can be said for Talent under a Walker presidency.If Bush, the candidate being advised by Richard Fontaine, is challenged by the need to distinguish his foreign-policy vision from that of his brother, Talent’s candidate — a Wisconsin governor with no experience on international issues — is obligated to come up with a vision from scratch. Talent asserts that Walker, the man who dismantled Wisconsin’s public-employee unions, will face down enemies abroad with equal fortitude. On Aug. 28 at the Citadel, Walker laid out his own foreign-policy approach, emphasizing the need for strong executive leadership, much as Rubio’s foreign-policy address in May made the case that America must ‘‘lead with strength and principle,’’ and Jeb Bush’s speech in August cited America’s need to ‘‘lead again’’ in the Middle East — all of them stopping short of Lindsey Graham’s pledge to send 10,000 troops to Iraq.To assist in constructing Walker’s foreign policy, Talent says that he is urging the candidate to articulate what he also ‘‘hammered on Mitt’’ to put forward: an encompassing vision with strategic clarity that the public, Congress, allies and enemies can all understand. ‘‘The real lesson of Iraq,’’ he said, ‘‘is that you always have to ask, ‘O.K., what are we trying to achieve and how does it fit into our broader goals?’ ’’ He continued, ‘‘We can’t spend the next term with everybody pointing fingers about what went wrong with Iraq.’’Arguably, however, ‘‘what went wrong with Iraq’’ was that there was a strategically clear vision in play. It was called the Bush Doctrine, a post-9/11 articulation of neoconservatism. Among its central tenets, as enunciated frequently by Bush himself, was the determination to ‘‘take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us again here at home.’’ Walker has employed nearly identical rhetoric in describing how he would fight ISIS: ‘‘We need a leader who will look the American people in the eye and say, ‘We will do whatever it takes — whatever it takes — to make sure that radical Islamist terrorism does not wash up on American soil.’ I’d rather take the fight to them.’’I asked Michael Gallagher, the coordinator of Walker’s foreign-policy team, what distinguished his own philosophy from that of the neoconservatives. He replied that such distinctions weren’t meaningful, given that all Republicans favored a robust alternative to Obama’s seeming reluctance to lead: ‘‘I think lost in this debate between isolationism and neoconservatism is the fact that there is a striking amount of consensus within the party.’’ When I asked if there was anything in his experience — Gallagher was a Marine captain deployed to Anbar Province in late 2007 — that would make him question the neoconservative worldview, he paused at great length before finally saying, ‘‘I don’t have anything to offer on that.’’Republicans like Walker have criticized Obama’s incursion into Libya on the front end (‘‘leading from behind’’) as well as the back end (failing to prevent the free-for-all of warring militias that currently prevails there). But they have been far more reticent in explaining how they would have responded to the popular uprising against Qaddafi or to the Arab Spring in general. When I asked Talent, he thought for a moment before replying. ‘‘Well, I’ll tell you as Jim Talent — I don’t think Governor Walker has opined on this topic yet,’’ he said. ‘‘The question of when purely humanitarian goals, assuming there is such a thing, should be an object of American policy is one that I think reasonable people can really debate over.’’Prodded to specify what he would have advised the president to do in Libya, Talent mentioned ‘‘two reasonable options.’’ One would have been to limit American activity to humanitarian aid, on the grounds that the circumstances did not significantly affect our national interests. The other recourse would have been to drive Qaddafi out of power but then ‘‘continue to be involved post-conflict, to help ensure that the government that emerges is a partner.’’ In Talent’s view, ‘‘Either of those options would have been better than overthrowing him and seeing what happens next. Now we have a much worse humanitarian disaster and elements on the ground that are enemies of America.’’ Of course, as Talent conceded, he did not warn against such scenarios in real time, before the Libya bombing, just as many Republicans did not forecast the complications that would arise from invading Iraq in 2003.In May, Walker offered a textbook case of how a Republican presidential candidate can reframe the failures of the Iraq war: Skip past the first four years of chaotic bloodshed and focus instead on President Bush’s decision in 2007 to send another 20,000 troops into Iraq. Bush, Walker said, deserved ‘‘enormous credit for ordering the surge, a courageous move that worked,’’ and then lamented that Obama ‘‘threw away the gains of the surge,’’ with brutal consequences. And in his foreign-policy address last month, Jeb Bush also glossed over the questionable decision to invade Iraq and instead lavished praise on the surge as the ‘‘turning point we had all been waiting for,’’ one that was then squandered by Obama with a ‘‘premature withdrawal’’ of troops that constituted ‘‘the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill, and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.’’The only Republican candidate who has expressed disagreement with this point of view is Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Regarding the surge, Paul has offered measured praise: ‘‘It was a military tactic and it worked.’’ But he has flatly stated that ‘‘invading Iraq was a mistake.’’ Paul’s blunt assessment of the Iraq war has won him some peculiar bedfellows — among them, Elise Jordan, who served in Bush’s National Security Council’s communications team in Washington and Afghanistan and also traveled to Iraq while serving as a speechwriter for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She is now on the foreign-policy team of Paul, the least interventionist candidate in the Republican field. Jordan, who is 33, has often been asked variations of: ‘‘Wait. You work for Rand Paul? And you were in Iraq?’’ To which her reply has been: ‘‘Yes. Exactly.’’As a Bush staff member, Jordan watched Iraq degenerate into turmoil — observing at close hand, she said, ‘‘a really clear disconnect between what we were telling ourselves and what was happening on the ground.’’ The surge revived her hopes in America’s ability to quell sectarian violence by military means. But after leaving the White House, she worked as a freelance journalist, visiting Afghanistan in 2010 to embed with U.S. troops for an article about the military’s counterinsurgency efforts against the Taliban. This was during a troop surge modeled after the maneuver in Iraq, but in Afghanistan, the tactic proved ineffectual. Jordan began to question the value of the war there and, more broadly, the neoconservative notion that America can impose its values on other nations. ‘‘While I still believe that all people deserve freedom, it’s paternalistic to think we can bring it to them,’’ she told me.She met Paul in March 2013 — days after his nearly 13-hour filibuster relating to Obama’s drone program, and three months before her husband, the acclaimed Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings, was killed in an automobile accident. Echoing what Paul’s other advisers would tell me, Jordan was struck by how thoughtful and well read he seemed, belying the caricature of him as an isolationist. Since signing on, she has been surprised by the vigor with which the other candidates, particularly Marco Rubio, Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham, have attacked his foreign-­policy views. ‘‘The fact that so many are threatened by him is a sign of how the Republican Party can’t deal with some deviations from conventional thought,’’ she said.Those attacks have dwindled of late, no doubt because Paul has struggled to raise money, mount a disciplined campaign and break through the primal roar of the Trump movement. Still, it remains the case that Paul is the only candidate committed to designing a post-neocon Republican foreign policy. As another of his advisers, the Carnegie Mellon University international-relations professor Kiron Skinner, says, ‘‘He’s trying to provide a corrective to both the Bush and Obama administrations, in which we use American military power responsibly and when there’s a clear understanding of what’s needed.’’That feat has been difficult for Paul to pull off as he attempts to placate both the libertarian followers of his father, Ron Paul, and the conservative G.O.P. base. He has hedged on his commitment to eliminate all foreign aid, gone out of his way to show his support for Israel and adopted more confrontational language toward Syria and Iran. Paul has also said that if he were president, he would ‘‘seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily.’’ Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper to clarify what this would entail, he said that he meant ‘‘Arab boots on the ground.’’ The candidate has yet to elaborate on how he would be the first American president to inspire an Arab army to ‘‘destroy’’ an Islamist extremist group.Of course, presidential campaigns don’t tend to be incubators of complex foreign policy. Throughout the 2008 campaign cycle, Obama the candidate was fond of declaring on the stump that Al Qaeda grew stronger because the Iraq war had caused the Bush administration to ‘‘take our eye off the ball’’ instead of ‘‘refocusing our attention on the war that can be won in Afghanistan.’’ Today the president is at pains to explain why this refocusing has not come close to fulfilling his campaign declarations.Today’s foreign-policy thinkers must also test their idealistic notions of American possibility on a geo­political landscape littered with the wreckage of ideals past. As Richard Fontaine explained to me: ‘‘In Iraq, we toppled the government and did an occupation and everything went to hell. In Libya, we toppled the government and didn’t do an occupation and everything went to hell. In Syria, we didn’t topple the government and didn’t do an occupation and everything went to hell. So, broadly, this is the Middle East. Things go to hell. And we’ve got to make our way through that fact to protect our national interests, on the back of a war-weary public that doesn’t want to invest our treasure in this.’’That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America’s leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference’s main event was an hourlong debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national-security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michèle Flournoy, Obama’s former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush’s former Defense Department comptroller and foreign-­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama’s director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were the retired general David Petraeus, the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Jeb Bush’s outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS’s ideology was to ‘‘take territory away from ISIS.’’ And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: ‘‘The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?’’Zakheim’s realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation’s most intellectually rigorous foreign-­policy thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.But Fontaine was not won over. ‘‘Their argument — don’t roll them back, hold them in place and they’ll defeat themselves through their internal contradictions — has never happened to a terrorist group,’’ he said later. ‘‘And I think we can roll them back. We’ve already shrunk their territory by a third. Containment, if you stop there, is a recipe for endless bloodshed.’’ That was his distinctly minority, stubbornly hawkish opinion. And if Fontaine had his way, it would soon become Jeb Bush’s as well.
