(More than a dozen other films open today.)“The Imitation Game,” “The Theory of Everything,” “Foxcatcher” and “Birdman” have all drawn early praise ahead of their releases.And she says critics are holding out for Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” which comes out in November, and “Unbroken,” the Angelina Jolie film opening on Christmas Day.Joseph Burgess and Rick Rojas contributed reporting.Your Morning Briefing is posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern.What would you like to see here?
