(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. House Republicans struggled to get through their leadership crisis, pressuring a reluctant Paul Ryan to take up the speaker’s gavel. Some said he was softening and would head back to Wisconsin over the weekend to discuss the job with his family. “He’s the consensus candidate at this point,” one said._______2. Two more campus shootings in 12 hours, one in Arizona and one in Texas, claimed at least two lives. They occurred just eight days after an Oregon man killed nine people at a community college. Motives were still being sought, but researchers have found that there can be a kind of contagion with mass shootings._______3. The shootings shadowed President Obama’s visit to the Oregon town involved in last week’s shooting, Roseburg, where he met survivors and families of those killed. His welcome was mixed. Some signs in the crowd at the airport proclaimed “Welcome Obama,” but others said, “Go home” and “Gun-free zones are for sitting ducks.”_______4. Violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians spread to Gaza for the first time, after a Facebook page called “Third Intifada” called for people to “prepare your stones, knives and Molotovs.” The unrest began over allegations that Israel planned to restrict Muslim access to the Old City site revered by Palestinians as the Noble Sanctuary and Jews as the Temple Mount. (The authorities have not.)_______5. “I’m never getting out,” Donald Trump insisted on MSNBC. But the Republican presidential candidate has been dropping hints of an exit strategy as his lead in national polls has shrunk. “Even back in the summer, when he was somewhat defying gravity, somewhat defying conventional wisdom, it seemed to me there would be a moment when reality sets in,” a Republican strategist said._______6. The Obama administration abandoned the Pentagon’s training program for Syrian rebels, weeks after a top general said the $500 million effort had just “four or five” fighters in the field. The U.S. still hopes to assemble a coalition of Syrian Sunnis to join Kurdish forces against the Islamic State._______7. There had been talk about Pope Francis winning the Nobel Peace Prize, but the awards committee once again surprised the world. The honoree was a group of organizations, the National Dialogue Quartet, that shepherded Tunisia from the chaos of the Arab Spring uprising through a relatively successful transition to democracy._______8. “Steve Jobs,” starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogen, has a limited opening ahead of its broad release on Oct. 22. Our reviewer calls it “a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting.”_______9. Looking ahead: North Korea, which knows how to put on a spectacle, is preparing for one of its biggest celebrations ever on Saturday, for the 70th anniversary of the founding of its ruling party. There were reports that it may also launch test missiles as part of its muscle flexing._______10. And the brash comedian Amy Schumer logs another coup in her banner year, hosting “Saturday Night Live” for the first time. (NBC, 11:30 p.m. Eastern)_______11. Watch: Robots can be gentle, too. MIT researchers developed a silicone robotic hand whose embedded sensors allow it to differentiate between hard and soft objects. It can just as easily pick up an egg as a stuffed toy.Have a great weekend. Video produced by Sofia Perpetua.
