Two minutes after the polls closed in Greece on Sunday night, activists for the left-wing Syriza party celebrated projections of a decisive victory by posting a link on Twitter to “People Have the Power,” a song by the American poet and singer Patti Smith that has become something of an unofficial anthem for the populist movement.A look at the lyrics to the song — which Ms. Smith performed in Greece in 2013 during a concert at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on the southern slopes of the Acropolis — makes plain its appeal to supporters of the anti-austerity party.As my colleague Rachel Donadio reported in 2012, the song was a regular feature of Syriza rallies during the last election campaign, too. Syriza’s main rival, the center-right New Democracy Party, has relied on a less alternative tune to rev up supporters: the theme song to “Pirates of the Caribbean.”Journalists following party’s campaign in recent days reported that the soundtrack at the rallies of Syriza’s leader, Alexis Tsipras, has also included “Rock the Casbah,” from the Clash, and — more pointedly, given the tension between Greece and Germany over austerity — Leonard Cohen’s “First We Take Manhattan,” which features the refrain, “Then We Take Berlin.”
