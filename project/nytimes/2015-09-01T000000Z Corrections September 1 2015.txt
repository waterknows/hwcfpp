FRONT PAGEAn article on Monday about pressure on the Federal Reserve from groups with differing ideas on when the Fed should raise interest rates misidentified, in some editions, the group that organized the “Fed Up” campaign, which wants the Fed to keep rates low, to lower unemployment rates and to raise living standards. It is the Center for Popular Democracy, not the Center for Public Democracy.BUSINESS DAYAn article on Aug. 21 about the rising number of recalls of organic products, using information from Stericycle, a company that handles recalls for businesses, misstated the proportion of recalls of organic products since 2012 that were related to bacterial contamination. It is 87 percent of such recalls, not “all” of them.OBITUARIESAn obituary on Monday about the electrical engineer James L. Flanagan referred incorrectly to Richard M. Nixon, in whose last days as president Dr. Flanagan played a small role. Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment; he was not impeached.•An obituary in some editions on Monday about the filmmaker Wes Craven misidentified the film of his that featured a dream sequence that inspired his “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” It is “Last House on the Left,” not “The Hills Have Eyes.” The obituary also misstated part of the name of the university from which Mr. Craven received a master’s degree in philosophy. It is Johns Hopkins, not John Hopkins.The Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
