The New York State Senate sometimes considers weighty matters like taxes and budgets.On Tuesday, it focused its attention on yogurt.Specifically, it took up a proposal to designate yogurt as the official state snack. Yogurt production happens to be a booming industry upstate.But in Albany, no matter is too small to provoke disagreement. And honoring yogurt, it turned out, was too much for some lawmakers to stomach.One senator, Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, suggested the designation might be inconsiderate to people who are lactose intolerant. Another, Gustavo Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, wondered if yogurt could count as a snack if it were consumed at breakfast time.Alternative snack ideas were raised. The distinction between Greek yogurt and regular yogurt was clarified.“Almost 7 o’clock and we are here discussing yogurt,” said Senator Rubén Díaz Sr., a Bronx Democrat.The yogurt proposal was the idea of a fourth-grade class, according to the bill’s sponsor, Michael H. Ranzenhofer, a Republican from western New York. “This is really democracy in action,” he said.Ms. Krueger suggested the state should more thoroughly seek to gauge the snack-related sentiments of its residents. Mr. Ranzenhofer said elected officials needed to show leadership.Most senators agreed: The Senate voted 52 to 8 in favor of yogurt. The bill’s fate now rests with the State Assembly.
