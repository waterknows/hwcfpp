BANGKOK — Thailand’s election commission on Wednesday said it would try to hold a vote in July but opposition leaders refused to say whether they would participate, underlining the country’s political paralysis.Puchong Nutrawong, the secretary general of the Election Commission, said he would propose that elections be held July 20 in a decree that will be submitted to the king next week.Amid continued protests and a sagging economy, Thailand has been without a fully functioning government since December. The caretaker administration of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been short of cash and has failed to make payments to about one million farmers.Anti-government protesters seeking to oust Ms. Yingluck obstructed a first round of elections in February and on Wednesday renewed a pledge to seize power and appoint a prime minister. The standoff has been periodically punctuated by violence including the assassination of a prominent government supporter last week.Suthep Thaugsuban, the main leader of the protest movement, did not mention the election date in an address to his supporters late Wednesday, but said protesters would “regain sovereign power” and appoint a prime minister.“We are not going to compromise with the thieves of the country,” Mr. Suthep said.The political crisis centers on the polarizing rule of Ms. Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a tycoon who built up a sweeping political movement in northern Thailand that antagonized the Bangkok establishment, which accuses Mr. Thaksin of monopolizing power.The crisis has evolved into a standoff between supporters of the governing party pushing for elections that they are confident they will win, and a protest movement skeptical of electoral democracy and trying to handpick a leader.Legal proceedings against Ms. Yingluck may further complicate the picture: a court is scheduled to decide in the coming weeks whether to remove her from office on the grounds that she illegally transferred a top civil servant.
