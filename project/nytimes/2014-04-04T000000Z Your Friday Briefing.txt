Welcome to the Morning Briefing on NYT Now, the new app from The New York Times.The briefing goes live at 6 a.m. to help you get ready for your day.Here’s what you need to know for Friday:• What caused the Fort Hood gunman to snap?Military investigators are delving further today into the background of the soldier who killed three people and himself at Fort Hood, Tex.Specialist Ivan Antonio Lopez had a “clean record,” officials said.He was being treated for depression and anxiety, but had no violent signs.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, used the killings to renew his call for new gun control legislation.• Watching for the most-watched economic indicator.Economists are forecasting that the March employment report, due out this morning, will say the nation added 200,000 jobs last month.The unemployment rate, they predict, probably edged down to 6.6 percent, but many say that is a less reliable flag of overall economic health.Update: About 192,000 jobs were created last month, and the jobless rate stayed at 6.7 percent, the government said.• An Associated Press photographer died today after an attack in Afghanistan.Anja Niedringhaus, a German who was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2005 for photography of the Iraq War, and Kathy Gannon, an A.P. reporter, were shot by a police officer.The reporter, a Canadian, was in critical condition.• The president meets with the head of Tunisia’s “start-up” democracy.President Obama today greets the acting prime minister of Tunisia, which overthrew its longtime dictator in 2011, the advent of the Arab Spring.“I don’t like to speak of Tunisia as an Arab Spring country, but as a start-up democracy,” Mehdi Jomaa said in a speech this week.MARKETS• Wall Street traded higher after the jobs report, but then slipped. European shares closed modestly ahead, and Asia ended mostly lower.• Eating up an I.P.O.GrubHub, the online takeout ordering service, trades publicly for the first time today after raising its offering price to $26 a share.Update: The shares soared 40 percent in midday action.• Arguments over General Motors recall.A lawyer for owners of G.M. vehicles asks a federal district court in Texas today to order that 2.6 million recalled cars not be driven until they are repaired.G.M. argues that the recall should instead be overseen by the government.NOTEWORTHY• Don’t tag President Obama in that selfie.The White House thought the Red Sox star David Ortiz didn’t act so diplomatically when the photo he took with the president turned out to be a promotion for Samsung.“We certainly object in this case,” said Jay Carney, press secretary.• A new gloss on civil rights history.Forty-six years ago today, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis.On Saturday, the National Civil Rights Museum reopens inside the former motel after a $28 million overhaul.Edward Rothstein, our museum critic, says in a review that “the room’s frozen tableau and the museum’s survey of riots and mourning — all point to a project left unfinished.”• Florida is No. 1, but a national basketball title is far from certain. For Florida to win, Ben Shpigel, one of our sports reporters, told us, “it must first topple Connecticut, which dealt the Gators their last loss, before defeating either Wisconsin, the only other school to beat them this season, or Kentucky.”Phew.The games, both on Saturday, are Florida vs. Connecticut, 6:09 p.m. Eastern, TBS, and Wisconsin vs. Kentucky, 8:49 p.m., TBS.• The “Breaking Bad” book.The Emmy-award winning actor Bryan Cranston promises to disclose the “secrets and lies” of the smash TV show.The book, announced Thursday, is to be released in the fall of 2015.BACK STORYAfghans will vote for a new president on Saturday, and all we know for sure is that he will not be named Karzai.It will take months to sort out the results, most likely requiring a runoff vote months from now to find out who will replace Hamid Karzai.“That means the Obama administration, and the fate of thousands of American troops, will be up in the air, too,” said Douglas Schorzman, The Times’s editor for Afghanistan and Pakistan.The administration says time is running out for a new security deal to keep troops in Afghanistan.“If it takes too long to get a new Afghan president who can sign the agreement, it’s possible that everyone will be pulled out, for keeps, by year’s end,” he said.Rick Rojas contributed reporting.Your Morning Briefing is posted weekdays at 6 a.m.Don’t miss Your Evening Briefing at 6 p.m. weekdays.What would you like to see here?
