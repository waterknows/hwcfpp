(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. There was no consensus on who won the fourth Republican presidential debate, but there were some notable bloopers. Economists disputed Ben Carson’s assertion that every minimum-wage rise has been followed by more joblessness. And Donald Trump said the Trans-Pacific Partnership would allow China to “totally take advantage of everyone.” Rand Paul corrected him — China is not a signatory to the pact, whose goal is to counter China’s trade power._______2. Philosophers our reporters consulted tended to disagree with a comment from Marco Rubio, as he argued for more vocational training, that “Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.” Welders, however, tended to agree. Data shows that money-wise, “welders, cutters, solderers and brazers” make an average of $40,040 — around the median salary of a newly graduated philosophy major._______3. The United States honored Veterans Day. We offer you a quote from the theologian and poet G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936): “Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.”_______4. The student encampment protesting racism at a University of Missouri campus was dismantled. But security ratcheted up and some professors canceled classes after the police arrested a man for making what they said was a “terrorist threat” and rumors of violence swirled on social media — including a false report of a Ku Klux Klan presence on campus._______5. More than 60 leaders from Africa and Europe began two days of talks on the migration crisis on the Mediterranean island nation of Malta. Europe offered to spend almost $2 billion to repatriate African migrants and address the economic and security conditions they fled, but African leaders urged more focus on allowing them to stay in Europe._______6. One of our Mideast correspondents made a 10-day trip to northeastern Syria, along the Turkish border, in areas where Kurdish fighters pushed out Islamic State fighters. He heard tales of executions and abuses, and found people “scrambling to fill the void left by the collapse of the Syrian state.”_______7. Myanmar’s president, a former general, saluted the victory of the country’s democracy movement and its leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, writing on Facebook that the government would “work on transferring power peacefully.” That put to rest any remaining worries of a repeat of 1990, when her party won broadly, and the military responded by crushing the movement and putting her under years of house arrest._______8. Workers using rakes and superheated steam chipped away at Seattle’s infamous gum wall by the Pike Place Market. It’s collected up to a million wads since the ’90s, when patrons waiting to get into a comedy club first started encrusting it. The market expects gum stickers to rebuild what a spokeswoman called “a crowdsourced piece of public art.”_______9. Sales were through the roof for China’s annual Singles’ Day (pegged to the date 11/11), which has grown into an online shopping extravaganza on par with Cyber Monday in the U.S. China’s two largest online retailers said totals smashed last year’s record. Foreign companies got into the action, too._______10. Our tech columnist found out how easy it can be to get marijuana legally, thanks to a host of start-ups. From his home in California, he consulted a doctor online for heartburn, uploaded her recommendation for medical marijuana to a dispensary and received the delivery less than an hour after ordering. “The entire process was easier than ordering a pizza,” he wrote._______11. The European Union said Israel must label products coming from settlements, which include wine, honey, olive oil and cosmetics. The move deepened frictions with Israel, which is facing a growing international movement urging boycotts, disinvestment and sanctions against the country until it returns to its 1967 borders._______12. Lastly, a 32-year-old orangutan living at Zoo Atlanta has proven to be a great mother, though she’s never had offspring of her own. Handlers say Madu has taken well to her fourth adopted baby, this seven-month-old who arrived in October from a Wisconsin zoo. Madu is helping pick up the slack for first-time orangutan mothers, who often have less than model nurturing skills._______Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to look back?
