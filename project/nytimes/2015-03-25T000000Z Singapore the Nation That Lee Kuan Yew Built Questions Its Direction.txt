SINGAPORE —  Among the many orders that Lee Kuan Yew issued during his five decades as leader of Singapore was the razing of his home.“I’ve told the cabinet, ‘When I’m dead, demolish it,’ ” he told an interviewer several years ago.Pragmatic even about death and averse to a cult of personality, Mr. Lee, who died Monday at age 91, said the house would cost too much to maintain and would become a shambles when “people trudge through.”There was no wrecking ball on Mr. Lee’s quiet street on Tuesday, and the official memorial does not begin until the public viewing of his coffin in Parliament on Wednesday.But Singaporeans are asking the same questions about the larger house that Lee Kuan Yew built — modern Singapore and the vaunted “Singapore model.” Will it survive him, or has the sleek Asian financial hub outgrown his father-knows-best style of government?Among members of the country’s increasingly assertive and demanding electorate, there are calls for a new social contract, a more consultative government and participatory rule-making.“Singapore is at an inflection point,” said Kishore Mahbubani, the country’s former ambassador to the United Nations. “I think the young population of Singapore appreciates the strength of Singapore, appreciates the stability the Singapore government brings, but they also want more voices. So you’ve got to create opportunities for them to speak out — social issues, on political issues, on economic issues. It’s coming. Change is coming.”The Singapore model that transformed this former British colonial outpost into a tidy, gleaming metropolis was a mix of semi-authoritarian, one-party rule; meticulous urban planning; laissez-faire economic policies; low taxes; and heaps of imported foreign talent. The loss of personal freedoms and government intrusiveness — like muzzling political dissent and issuing fines for failing to flush public toilets — in exchange for order and prosperity was a trade-off broadly accepted by a generation of Singaporeans who saw their country’s living standards rocket beyond those of its neighbors.Many became loyal acolytes of Mr. Lee’s governing party, which has held power without interruption since independence five decades ago. But to younger generations, for whom stability and one of the world’s highest per capita incomes are a given, good sidewalks, clean tap water and graft-free government may no longer be enough.“The Third-World-to-First-World in one generation narrative has less traction with the younger Singaporeans,” said Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at Singapore Management University. The governing party’s monopoly on power may not end soon, but the expectations are changing.“It’s not a question of whether but rather when Singapore will evolve to a two-party or multiparty democracy,” he said.Nor will the government have Mr. Lee, who was viewed as a sort of strict national grandfather, both loved and feared, to defend it. None of his successors, not even his son, the current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, have the same prestige and authority.Issues that were unthinkable when Lee Kuan Yew was alive now cannot be dismissed as easily, including the prospect that his People’s Action Party could split into factions, a possibility that some believe is beginning to take shape.“Anything is possible,” said Kenneth Paul Tan, the vice dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “When you have very talented people gathered in an organization, there will be differences in view and ambitions.”The Internet has amplified divergent opinions and bypassed a tightly controlled media that over the years has acted less like a watchdog and more like a cheerleading squad for the government and its ambitions. Partly because of social media, Singapore appears more divided than in the past.The most prominent and contentious issues are bread-and-butter concerns: a surge in immigration over the last decade, rising living costs and soaring property prices.Tan Wee Cheng, 45, a management consultant, said Singaporeans felt vulnerable and were concerned about “how to survive and make a living in a highly competitive society with a labor market that is open to the rest of the world.”Battling a low birthrate among its citizens, the government opened the floodgates to foreign labor over the last decade and a half. More than a third of the 5.5 million people living in Singapore today are not citizens.The number of nonresident immigrants has more than doubled since 2000, to nearly 1.6 million from 754,000. The number of foreigners given permanent resident status also nearly doubled during the same period, to just over 500,000.At the higher income end, Singaporeans feel threatened by foreign executives and managers brought in to run the city-state’s world-class companies. At the lower income end, Singapore benefits from foreign workers in shopping malls, at construction sites and in restaurants. Critics say the country’s fragile national identity, which was still a work in progress, has been interrupted by the surge of immigrants.The backlash against immigrants has boxed in the government. In response, it has imposed restrictions making it harder to hire foreigners. But at the same time, it plans to increase the country’s population to 6.9 million by 2030, mainly through immigration.Other cracks starting to show in the Singapore model stem from complaints over a lack of freedom of expression and political pluralism. Catherine Lim, a social critic and author, wrote a widely circulated open letter to the government last year taking it to task for not listening to the concerns of its citizens. It began, “We are in the midst of a crisis where the people no longer trust their government, and the government no longer cares about regaining their trust.”She assailed the government for hardball tactics against its political opponents, saying it had “no qualms” about reducing them to bankruptcy.This month, Singapore’s High Court fined a blogger, Alex Au, the equivalent of $5,800 for “scandalizing contempt” of the judiciary.His crime? Mr. Au, a gay rights activist, had questioned why the Supreme Court had scheduled the hearing of a constitutional challenge to a British colonial-era law banning gay sex ahead of a separate challenge filed before it.The case was not about homosexuality, he said, but political control.“What has happened in the last 20 years is that the government has loosened up, but only in ways that are not politically threatening — sex, gambling,” he said. “It’s a camouflage for the fact that detention without charge is very much on the books, and newspapers must be licensed.”Karim Raslan, a regional political analyst and newspaper columnist, said the leadership in Singapore would be forced to adjust its tone.“As a leader in Singapore now, you have to be more inclusive, you have to be able to persuade more and bring people along with you,” he said. “Lee’s iron hand did not really allow for much dissent, but today the hierarchical nature of Singapore has broken down.”For decades the governing People’s Action Party faced a token opposition with only a handful of seats in Parliament. But the party’s share of the vote has been steadily declining since 2001. In 2011, voters, including young Singaporeans, dealt the party its worst setback yet, awarding it only 60 percent of the popular vote.The next general election must be held by January 2017 but may be called sooner, in part because the government may seek to benefit from the nostalgia and affection for Mr. Lee after his death.Mr. Tan, the vice dean at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said he expected Singapore to enter a period of introspection after the ceremonies and eulogies for Lee Kuan Yew, including the state funeral on Sunday.“It cannot be just the government leading the way forward,” he said. “The people have to be as much a part of this, so a new social contract can be forged which can be legitimate to all.”If so, it is a lesson the government is still learning. On Monday, the government banned protests and other gatherings at Hong Lim Park, whose Speakers’ Corner was one place free speech was traditionally tolerated.Instead, the National Parks Board announced, the park would be a designated site “for remembering the late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.”
