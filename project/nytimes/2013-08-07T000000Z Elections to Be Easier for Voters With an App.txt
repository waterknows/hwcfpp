The election process can, at times, feel impossibly old-fashioned, as evidenced by the return of mechanical lever voting machines for this year’s New York City primaries. But this election season, the city will try to make it easier to register to vote, give money and communicate with campaigns, all from the palm of your hand.On Wednesday, the New York City Campaign Finance Board will unveil NYC Votes, a mobile app meant to boost political participation via smartphones.“We want people to experience the same power and relationship to this ‘store for democracy’ — which is what an election is — that they experience on Amazon,” said Art Chang, a member of the finance board and the founder of Tipping Point Partners, a firm that brings together entrepreneurs and start-ups.The app will allow residents to begin the voter registration process, using account data to fill out the form; the document will still have to be signed by hand and submitted by mail, but the form will be easier to obtain. The app will also allow users to make campaign contributions, using saved data for a quick, Amazon-esque “fast checkout” donation that complies with the city’s strict regulations.The app is being rolled out in phases at www.nycvotes.org. At first, it will feature a countdown to registration deadlines, a location-based look-up for candidates and the ability to check voter registration status. The contributions function will take a few more weeks.The ability to collect donations by smartphone is expected to be of particular use to small campaigns, Mr. Chang said, because data collection and submission that once required a small army of volunteers can be done with a couple of taps on the glass screen of a smartphone.The app will also show donors how the value of their contributions can be amplified by the city’s matching funds program for small contributions; under the city’s voluntary program, small contributions are matched 6 to 1, so the app will show donors of $10 that their contribution could bring the campaign $70.In early July, a preliminary version of the app was released to 30 local campaigns.It was designed and developed by Pivotal Labs, Tipping Point Partners and Method and will be open-source, allowing other developers to improve it or to use it in other municipalities.“One thing we talked about is the idea that putting better digital tools out in the marketplace puts the pressure on the Legislature to change the laws and kind of push these kinds of tools,” said David Lipkin, one of the founders of Method. “To register to vote, you still need a wet-ink signature. If we got past some of that, we might get more tools like this that work better.”
