(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The Paris attacks dominated the news. French authorities concluded that this 27-year-old Belgian, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, led the plot. Investigators described a network of radicalized Muslims centered in Mr. Abaaoud’s grimy district of Brussels, Molenbeek. Security forces scoured that area for an eighth suspect in Friday night’s attacks who was still on the loose._______2. Military action against the Islamic State escalated. President François Hollande told Parliament, “France is at war,” a day after French warplanes bombed the group’s self-declared capital in Raqqa, Syria. The U.S., in a campaign planned before the Paris attacks, struck at hundreds of trucks smuggling crude oil from fields in Syria that have been bringing the group tens of millions of dollars a month._______3. Signs of shock, grief and fear were everywhere in Paris. Unease among French Muslims grew as Mr. Hollande asked Parliament to extend a state of emergency and called for changing the Constitution to address terrorism. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived on a visit that was not announced for security reasons. The timing of the attacks — ahead of a holiday season that usually fills Paris with tourists and shoppers — could now damage France’s recovering economy._______4. President Obama, leaving the G20 meeting in Turkey for a major Asian economic meeting in Manila, rejected calls to send U.S. ground troops to fight the Islamic State. He said he would not alter his strategy of airstrikes and aid to local forces just to “make America look tough or make me look tough.” He disagreed with some Republicans’ efforts to block Syrian refugees from entering the U.S._______5. And the attacks renewed tensions over government surveillance and privacy rights. The C.I.A. director, John Brennan, denounced “hand-wringing” by privacy advocates and blamed leaks, like those by Edward Snowden, for allowing terrorists to learn how to sidestep monitoring. Investigators presume the Paris attackers used encrypted chat apps._______6. In other news, Myanmar offered a bright spot, holding its first parliamentary session after free elections that saw a long-suppressed democracy movement triumph. The movement’s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, cannot herself become president because of constitutional rules against her marriage to a foreigner, but has promised to choose a leader she will rule “above.”_______7. The exact shape of the jawbone of this rodentlike creature — arrived at using CT scans and 3-D printing — has persuaded many scientists that it was not, after all, a mammal. The fossils were from some 210 million years ago, and so the finding offers strong support for the thesis that mammals originated about 175 million years ago, in the Jurassic period.8. The actor Charlie Sheen, who has openly acknowledged drug use problems, is to appear on the “Today” show on Tuesday to make a personal announcement, and a welter of reports said the disclosure is that he is H.I.V. positive. (Show begins 7 a.m., exact time of interview uncertain, NBC)9. You can stay at a really big hotel chain now. Marriott International is buying Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, a $12.2 billion deal for the company that includes Westin, the W, Sheraton and St. Regis. The merged company will have 5,500 owned or franchised hotels with 1.1 million rooms around the world.10. Football fans have begun pondering a future without Peyton Manning as quarterback. Playing injured, he was benched Sunday night after four interceptions. “By going out there and trying to help the team, I ended up hurting the team,” he said after his Denver Broncos lost to the Kansas City Chiefs, 29-13.Lastly, Oxford Dictionaries announced its word of the year, which, oddly enough, is not exactly a word. It was the “face with tears of joy” emoji._______Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to look back?
