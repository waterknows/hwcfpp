As the death toll mounts in Yemen, and airstrikes make life in the capital, Sana, a nerve-racking ordeal, Yemeni bloggers continue to post firsthand dispatches on social networks, frequently tagged with the Arabic word kefaya, meaning “enough.”
            Big explosions. 3:58 am local time. We're growing sick of this with no end in sight. Enough! #KefayaWar 
            Kefaya means "enough". Yemenis are speaking to all: Coalition #Decisive_Storm, Houthis, Saleh, Iran , Hadi everyone! #KefayaWar #Yemen

            After targeting the Army's bakery in Sanaa. #DecisiveStorm targets a milk factory in Hodeida.Can someone tell me WTH is going on! #KefayaWar This stream of Twitter S.O.S. messages came after strikes on an arms depot late Monday ignited missiles stored on a hill above Sana, sending shrapnel from secondary explosions flying into the air close to civilian neighborhoods.
            A door of hell had just been opened in #Sanaa #Now. Omg sounds of explosions everywhere!!

My kids and nephews. Secondary explosions continue. #OpDecisiveStorm pic.twitter.com/PoCIpYYAV6 In addition to using Twitter to urge an end to the violence, Yemenis also scoured the network for information about what was happening on the other side of the Saudi border, finding images that appeared to show armor moving in their direction and a patriotic song celebrating the Saudi-led offensive.

            Saudi singer composes a song romanticising #Decisive_Storm. Song means "War is welcome, we are up for it". #Yemen

            When I see Saudi tweeps cheering for war in #Yemen. I remember the Yemeni proverb: "War is so easy for spectators". #KefayaWar
