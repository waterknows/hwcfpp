BEIJING — With most students gone for the summer, the campus of Peking University is relatively quiet in August, save for the busloads of awe-struck adolescents on organized tours who hope to be among the 2,600 freshmen admitted each year to the Harvard of China, as it is widely known here.But beneath the tranquillity is a brewing tempest that is pitting the administration against many of the university’s students and a number of professors over plans to establish a gleaming new school intended largely for foreigners, most of whom will be taught in English, not Mandarin.In recent months, opponents of Yenching Academy, as it is known, have been waging a noisy campaign against the one-year, all-expense-paid graduate program in Chinese studies. Although roughly a third of the incoming class of 100 students will be Chinese nationals, the academy is being heavily marketed overseas, which appears to have intensified the outcry.The academy, which seeks to produce “an elite class of future leaders,” is planned to be built around a grassy quad that once served as imperial gardens, a place that many consider the historic and symbolic heart of China’s first modern university, founded in 1898.“Yenching Academy will provide its students and teachers a great number of privileges, something that’s clearly unfair to other Peking University students,” said Gao Fengfeng, dean of the English department, who has been one of the project’s most adamant critics.In the nearly four months since Peking University announced plans for the academy, students have been pressing school officials to change key aspects of the project; some have vowed to slow construction through protests or litigation. Several have posted photos of themselves online bearing handwritten slogans of resistance, a risky gesture in a country that does not countenance public protest.“We realize our actions will probably result in our ruination, but many students feel Yenching Academy is a fundamental violation of China’s most hallowed educational institution,” said a law student who asked to remain anonymous after a student leader affiliated with the Communist Party warned him against talking to the news media.The conflict at one of the country’s most fabled institutions of higher learning comes at a politically delicate time in China. Slowing economic growth, heightened restrictions on the news media and the Internet, and a government propaganda campaign against liberal ideology and values have stoked frustrations among many Chinese college students, especially those who look to the West for inspiration.In interviews, several of the university’s students seemed to relish the opportunity to stand up for something they believe in; they also evoked the school’s long tradition of political activism, which has been largely moribund since Chinese troops crushed the pro-democracy protests of 1989. Peking University students played a leading role in the early days of the protests, and a number of them were killed during the military crackdown or punished afterward.Joe Zhang, 21, a law student, said he and his more politically minded classmates were disillusioned by the focus on material wealth that he said dominates the ambitions of many Chinese students. “There are too many injustices in society that we are powerless to change, but this is one thing affecting our community we can challenge,” he said. “This has been an awakening.”Opponents cite a number of reasons for their vehemence. They object to plans that will turn several historic buildings into classrooms for the academy, while others have criticized the program itself, saying a one-year master’s degree is superficial and will devalue other graduate degrees at the school that require two or more years of study.In many ways, the dispute reflects the sometimes incongruous mix of national pride and cultural insecurity felt by many Chinese intellectuals. The belief that administrators are seeking to favor non-Chinese students has fueled some of the most vociferous opposition. In an online essay last month, two scholars who are graduates of Peking University described the planned academy as an act of “cultural poisoning and self-betrayal,” likening it to the colonized Chinese cities of the early 20th century that cordoned foreigners and natives into separate sections.School officials have attributed much of the resistance to rumors and misunderstandings, especially suggestions that Yenching students will live in a walled-off compound or that they will be given lavish stipends and luxurious dorm rooms.“This is something that adds to Bei Da, it doesn’t take away anything,” said John Holden, one of the academy’s associate deans, using the common shorthand for Peking University.Mr. Holden and other school officials dispute the contention, made by many students and faculty members, that they are ignoring popular sentiment, noting that the university has already agreed to abandon one key element of the academy: an underground collection of lecture halls that would have required the excavation of the grassy expanse where students have long gathered to study, play badminton or romance fellow classmates after dark. In another concession, they also recently agreed to build dormitories elsewhere on campus.With the first class scheduled for fall of 2015, administrators are eager to assuage some of the opposition and begin construction. Officials have not disclosed how much the academy will cost, but said it would be financed by wealthy Chinese donors.Plans to establish the academy come at a time when many of China’s top universities are in a race to enhance their rankings and raise their international profiles. Many schools have been on a building spree and aggressively signing partnerships with universities in the West.For Peking University, the rivalry is especially fierce with Tsinghua University, which is also in Beijing’s northern suburbs, and counts President Xi Jinping and former President Hu Jintao among its alumni. Some critics say Peking University rushed ahead with Yenching Academy in response to a graduate program — created with $100 million in seed money from Stephen A. Schwarzman, the American private-equity mogul — that will be established at Tsinghua in 2016. “Schwarzman Scholars,” as the students will be called, will also spend a year studying a number of subjects in English, including business, international relations and public policy.Like the Schwarzman Scholars program, Yenching’s stated mission dovetails with the Communist Party’s efforts to raise the global profile of Chinese universities while cultivating more favorable attitudes toward China in the West. During the ceremony announcing the academy’s creation, school officials said one goal was to produce an elite network of overseas graduates who will “understand, appreciate and love Chinese culture” and “correct the expanding misunderstanding of China by the world.”That stated mission has stirred up anger from those who say it is not Peking University’s job to shape foreign attitudes about China. “The fundamental task of a university is to teach and nurture people, not to run leadership classes or entrepreneur classes,” read an unsigned faculty statement, published online last month, that demanded that the project be delayed for a year until issues over curriculum, recruitment and location are resolved.In an interview last month, Wang Bo, one of Yenching’s associate deans and the chairman of the university’s department of philosophy, sought to compare the debate to China’s own struggle over its identity.If allowed to flourish, he said, Yenching Academy will become an incubator for mutual understanding among nations while helping China find its way in the world. “When everyone comes together, we can mold ourselves through a collision of diverse cultures,” he said. “By allowing all kinds of people to come together and become part of our construction and transformation, China can only benefit.”
