“Get your billions back, America,” the tax preparer H&R Block urges in television advertisements.What many taxpayers may not realize is that they already do. When it comes to the government, taxing is often just another name for spending.There are tax credits and tax deductions; tax exclusions and tax exemptions; tax deferrals and tax reductions; tax discharges and tax preferences, all of which put money in people’s wallets rather than take it out.There is one critical difference between tax-related payouts, however, and those that come directly from the federal budget: Spending channeled through the tax code tends to overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans.According to an analysis of $340 billion in tax subsidies for housing, education, retirement and savings in 2013, the top 1 percent received about $95 billion, more than the $90 billion received by the bottom 80 percent combined, said the Corporation for Enterprise Development, a nonprofit organization that seeks to build assets for low- and moderate-income families.“Every year, the federal government spends billions of dollars on these tax programs primarily to support the highest-income households that need support the least,” said Ezra Levin, associate director of government affairs for the group, which is based in Washington.Relentless pressure in recent years, particularly by conservatives, to reduce program spending has meant that the tax code has increasingly become the primary driver of social policy when it comes to education, retirement and housing.The amount of spending in those areas channeled through taxes is on the rise, topping $620 billion in 2014, up from $540 billion in 2013, according to Mr. Levin’s analysis. By comparison, federal discretionary spending by 14 of the 15 cabinet agencies, including housing, transportation, labor, commerce, education, Treasury and health and human services totaled $464 billion.“This is not a liberal position or a conservative position,” he said.Those at the tippy-top of the income scale — the top 0.1 percent, with an average annual income of $7.6 million — received an average of $33,391 in federal tax payouts analyzed by the group. Those in the bottom 60 percent, who earn less than $65,000, got less than $1,000 on average, altogether about 12 percent of the billions handed out.A 2013 report from the Congressional Budget Office that looked at the 10 largest tax subsidies, worth a total of $900 billion, found that more than half went to households in the top fifth on the income scale.Neither analysis includes the new federal tax credits available to low- and moderate-income households that bought private health insurance on public marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act. Roughly 85 percent of the 16.4 million Americans who are insured through these exchanges receive a government subsidy to help pay premiums, according to figures released by the Obama administration this week. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the average subsidy in 2015 at $3,960. The bulk of this financial assistance, which is available through federal exchanges in 34 states, has been challenged by conservative opponents, and a Supreme Court ruling is expected in June.Once you exit the partisan muck surrounding the Obama administration’s health care program, however, Democrats and Republicans are largely united on many tax breaks, which were aimed at encouraging what are considered socially beneficial goals, like homeownership and college and retirement savings. Eliminating or reducing them can unleash a firestorm, as President Obama discovered when he proposed, and then abandoned, a plan to do away with the tax benefits for 529 college savings plans, where families can contribute up to $14,000 a year. Households with incomes above $150,000 received 80 percent of that program’s tax benefit, according to the White House.Other benefits similarly help largely upper-income families. The deduction for mortgage interest payments, one of the oldest and largest, and the one for property taxes together cost the federal government $98.5 billion in 2014. About 70 percent of the benefits went to the top quintile of earners. The average gain for a household in the bottom 20 percent — those earning less than $21,000 a year — amounted to $3, according to the enterprise development group.Other critics complain that these benefits are not that effective and point to research showing that rather than spurring would-be renters to buy a house, the deduction simply encourages existing buyers to purchase bigger homes.Retirement tax spending, totaling $146 billion in 2014, up from $128 billion from the previous year, also primarily benefits high-income households. The average annual benefit for the 1 percenters in 2013 equaled $13,088, compared with $200 or less for the bottom 60 percent, the development group found.Tax programs that do help those with less include the earned-income tax credit, a wage subsidy that increases the incomes of 27 million low-wage workers. Many economists and advocates consider it the most effective antipoverty measure around. The savers credit, which helps low- and moderate-income families build retirement savings, is also geared toward those with fewer resources.In his 2016 budget, President Obama proposed bulking up these programs, including a $500 tax credit for working parents with children. The White House estimated that the maximum credit would help those earning below $120,000, with some money funneled to households with incomes up to $210,000.Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has agreed that earned-income tax credits should be expanded to adults without children instead of just to parents, but he has balked at endorsing Mr. Obama’s proposed “second earner” tax credit.Tax policy tends to benefit those in the upper tier of the income ladder for several reasons. Wealthier households fall into higher income brackets, and so they get proportionately greater savings. They also have more assets to put into housing, retirement accounts and educational programs that are eligible for tax subsidies.Many economists have noted that from an accountant’s point of view, there is no difference between spending through the tax code and the budget. The minimum-wage worker who uses a federal voucher to help pay the rent and the Wall Street banker who deducts the mortgage interest on a multimillion-dollar vacation getaway in the Hamptons are both the recipients of government housing assistance.Donald Marron, a former member of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, called it “spending in disguise,” arguing that “the confusion surrounding such spending allows politicians to claim they are saving taxpayers’ money when, in fact, they are really spending it.”Congress started including what are known as tax expenditures in federal spending totals in 1976 as part of a budget reform package.Anti-tax advocates ardently dispute the notion that tax reductions are equivalent to public assistance. “That’s just stupid and dishonest,” said Ryan Ellis, tax policy director at the conservative Americans for Tax Reform. “Letting people keep their own money does not increase the size of government in any way.”Suzanne Mettler, a professor of government at Cornell University, counters that the government doesn’t bestow tax-related largess equally. “Just like direct social benefits, benefits in the tax code are directed at certain groups of people,” she said. Home buyers get a break; renters don’t, even if they both earn the same.To Ms. Mettler, the hidden nature of tax code spending undermines support for the government, because people don’t recognize just how much they benefit. Ms. Mettler, who is the author of “The Submerged State: How Invisible Government Policies Undermine American Democracy,” pointed to a 2008 poll from Cornell’s Survey Research Institute that found that a majority of Americans insisted they did not use any government programs, even when they took advantage of deductions on mortgage interest or student loans.She advocates providing receipts that detail just how much money someone receives through the tax code, a counterpart to the W-2s and other notices that list what someone pays.That way everyone would know just who is getting their billions back.
