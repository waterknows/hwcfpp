TEHRAN — An Iranian newspaper aligned with the country’s reform-minded new president was closed on Thursday by Iran’s judiciary, only six days after its first issue, local news outlets reported.It is unclear whether the closing, apparently over a quote from a political activist, who had said the bedrock eye-for-an-eye principle of Islamic law is inhumane, is permanent.“Aseman newspaper is banned for desecration of Islamic sanctities and publishing material that was against Islamic rulings,” the semiofficial Fars news agency reported.Aseman had been presented as a supporter of President Hassan Rouhani by its editor, Mohammad Qouchani, a veteran Iranian journalist and political activist. The closing seems aimed at preventing the government from having any news media outlets other than the official government newspaper, Iran, and the Islamic Republic News Agency.Since Mr. Rouhani took office in August, two reformist newspapers, Bahar and Hamihan, have been closed by the conservative judiciary, while another new paper, Neshat, was not even allowed to start publication.The government issued no public response to the closing of Aseman, which means “sky” in Persian. The phones went unanswered at the paper’s brand-new newsroom.A former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, had endorsed the paper in a letter published in its first edition on Saturday, saying, “Whenever the space for life tightens; whenever the land dries up and is deprived of water,” people “lift their eyes to the sky to keep hope alive.”The news media traditionally provides a battlefield for Iran’s reformist and conservative factions. While reformist outlets face heavy restrictions, papers, websites and news agencies linked to conservative groups are rarely harassed by the judiciary.“Whenever a government is elected to open up and promote democracy, the judiciary will crack down and restrict the observation of human rights, freedom of the press and so on,” said Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, the former head of Iran’s now-closed journalists’ association, who was in line to lead the Neshat newspaper.“When I wanted to open my newspaper, one judiciary official said the poisonous snakes were again crawling out of their holes,” he said, in reference to the reformist journalists.Last week, Iran’s culture minister, Ali Jannati, said the entire government strongly believed in freedom of expression, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. He also criticized the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for imposing “limitations” on the press.“We will support all writers, journalists who are involved in publishing weeklies, monthlies and other publications in this field,” said Mr. Jannati, who is the pragmatic son of one of Iran’s most influential conservative ayatollahs.After his election in June, Mr. Rouhani pledged to loosen restrictions on a variety of media, including millions of now-blocked websites, including Facebook and Twitter, but the sites are still inaccessible.
