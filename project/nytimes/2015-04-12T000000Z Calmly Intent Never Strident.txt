Hip-hop has a strong conscience in Latin America — a determination to speak for “all the silenced, all the neglected, all the invisible ones,” as the Chilean rapper Ana Tijoux declares in “Somos Sur” on her 2014 album, “Vengo.” Ms. Tijoux was born in France to Chilean parents who had fled the Pinochet dictatorship; she moved to Chile after democracy was restored. Her songs reach from personal experience toward social concerns, and they’re calmly assertive, never strident. The music traverses the Americas, from old school hip-hop to Andean flutes, and Ms. Tijoux’s tough-minded rhymes lead into lilting choruses. This week she plays three New York shows: two headlining club dates and a third as part of “Gracias a la Vida: The Rebel Spirit of Chile’s Legendary Voice,” a tribute to the crusading folklorist and songwriter Violeta Parra that is starting a United States tour. Ms. Tijoux shares the bill with the traditionalist Andean group Ilapu and with Colombina Parra, a punk-influenced niece of Violeta Parra. (Friday, 7:30 p.m., Pace’s Schimmel Center, 212-346-1715. Club dates sold out: 9 p.m., Friday, Bowery Ballroom; 11 p.m., Saturday, Rough Trade NYC.)
