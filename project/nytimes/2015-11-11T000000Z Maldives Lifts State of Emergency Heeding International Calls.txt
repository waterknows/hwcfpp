MALE, Maldives — The president of the Maldives on Tuesday revoked a state of emergency after less than a week, following widespread international condemnation and concerns about its impact on the country’s crucial tourism industry, the government said.President Abdulla Yameen declared the state of emergency last Wednesday, citing a security threat after a blast on his speedboat in September and the subsequent recovery of weapons and a homemade bomb near his official residence.The declaration was widely condemned for suspending basic citizens’ rights and for giving the military and the police the power to search and arrest almost at will.Under the emergency regulations, police officers were allowed to enter and search homes without a warrant, and the rights to assemble peacefully and travel between the many islands of the archipelago nation were suspended.Lawmakers used the regulations to vote Vice President Ahmed Adeeb out of office. The authorities suspected that Mr. Adeeb was behind alleged attempts on Mr. Yameen’s life, and he was arrested and detained.Mr. Yameen was not hurt in the Sept. 28 blast on his boat, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were wounded.The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday saying that the government had lifted the state of emergency “with immediate effect.”“With the lifting of the state of emergency, all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored,” the statement said.Attorney General Mohamed Anil said the president decided to revoke the state of emergency because good progress had been made in the investigations into the blast and the recovery of weapons and explosives. He also said Mr. Yameen had heeded international calls for the declaration to be lifted and wanted to reduce any impact it may have had on tourism.It is not clear how much of an impact the state of emergency has had on tourism in the Maldives, which is best known for its luxury resorts.The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday’s move, but said that the declaration had been political, designed to stop a rally planned for last Friday demanding the release of the party’s leader, former President Mohamed Nasheed.“It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation’s security in order to settle political scores,” the party said in a statement, referring to the president. “Yameen’s increasingly erratic, paranoid and dangerous behavior is damaging the country and proves he is unfit to be president. He has failed and should step down.”The Maldives has had a difficult transition to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008.
