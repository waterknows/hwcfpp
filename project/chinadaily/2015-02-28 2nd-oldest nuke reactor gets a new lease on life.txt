South Korea's nuclear commission on Friday decided to extend the operations of the country's second-oldest nuclear reactor till 2022 despite growing concerns over safety. 
The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission made the decision after 14 hours of debate. Seven members appointed by the government and the ruling party voted in favor of the extension. But two others, recommended by the main opposition party, boycotted the vote. 
The 679-megawatt Wolsong-1 reactor, located on the country's southeast coast, completed its 30-year life span in 2012 when it was turned off. The decision will extend the life of the heavy-water reactor for 10 more years. 
The state-run nuclear power operator Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power applied for the extension in December 2009 as the law requires application for safety inspection at least two years before the expiration date. 
The KHNP is planning to restart the Wolsong-1 reactor around April. 
The decision came amid mounting worries about nuclear safety following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Residents living near the reactor and environmental groups are planning to stage a rally against the decision, and the main opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy is set to convene parliamentary meetings to review problems. 
The nuclear operator said it had spent about 509 million since 2005 to replace parts and improve facilities at the Wolsong-1 reactor alone. 
In 2007, the country's oldest Gori-1 reactor, located in the southern port city of Busan, was allowed to remain on line for 10 more years. The light-water reactor began commercial operations in 1977. 
South Korea is operating 23 nuclear reactors, from which it meets almost 30 percent of its electricity demand. Five more reactors are under construction, with the building of six more to be introduced gradually.
