 Comment on "Lobbyists erode politics in the US" (China Daily, April 10)
The system of lobbying used in the United States is the same as the one that has eroded democracy and created a ruling elite in the United Kingdom. This has led to deeper corruption and a betrayal of the voter and the taxpayer as government officials have formally placed themselves above the law.
What people don't seem to understand is that once corrupt officials take high office they effectively join a club of greed and corruption that protects its members by keeping a lid over their illegal practices. The same is true of corruption through lobbying; the reason being that if one falls they might all fall. So members of the club of criminals and traitors have to protect each other and ensure the forces of law and order are under control. They have done that by making senior police appointments a matter for politicians and not the police service.
Lobbying has a very corrupting influence on and perverts the government where it is practiced. Those who lobby and those who accept benefits of any kind from lobbyists should face corruption charges and lose their positions. The punishments meted out to such people should be severe enough to deter others. In the US and UK, punishments are so small compared to the rewards of corruption through lobbying that fraud has become part of the political fabric. The result: these two terrible governments serve big business rather than their people and national interests.
China should keep up its good work and become a shining light to the world. Afraid of such a possibility, the West has been desperately trying to corrupt Chinese officials and the US is attempting to push other countries into conflict with China.
