 



Economic success has made Hong Kong a legend, earning the city a reputation as the "Pearl of the Orient", but recent political disputes and numerous squabbles have clouded the prospects for the city, blurring our vision for the future. 
Instead of "Pearl of the Orient", Hong Kong is now better known as the "capital of demonstrations". 
These endless squabbles mostly surround the pace of democracy as well as social issues such as poverty, the wealth gap, environmental protection and housing problems in the city. 
While people involved in these disputes may have valid reasons and justifiable causes, political confrontation could only retard our democratic development. After all, democracy is a gradual process rather than an abrupt revolution. 
And indulgence in internal strife could only undermine our economy and damage the government's efforts to solve social problems. 
These squabbles have started to take their toll on the local economy, with the city's overall global competitiveness slipping to third place from first previously, according to the 2013 World Competitiveness ranking compiled and released by IMD recently. 
Making matters worse, the so-called nativism, an emerging ideology being vigorously promoted by a few radical individuals in the city, will deprive Hong Kong its unique role as China's gateway to the world if it prevails. 
Over the decades, Hong Kong has achieved economic success and prosperity by serving as a gateway between the mainland and the rest of the world. Alienation from the mainland will take away the foundation of the city's economy. 
For the sake of the city, it is time now for all Hong Kong people to lay down our differences and rally behind the government in further developing the economy. With a stronger and bigger economy, many of our social problems will be solved readily and democracy will find a smoother road.
