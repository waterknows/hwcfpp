Comment on "Hagel visits China amid celebration and concern" (China Daily, April 1)
As a sometime contributor and reader, I generally admire China Daily's journalism. But today I must make some friendly criticism.
It is a mistake to invite the United States' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to visit sensitive Chinese military systems. The article puts a nice gloss on the visit with only very mild caveats.
However, every year the US proclaims its adherence to the one-China policy while in reality funding the separatist Tibetan "government-in-exile" with millions of dollars through the US government funded National Endowment for Democracy; it repeatedly sells hi-tech weapons to Taiwan and interfering in Hong Kong affairs; and it is encouraging Japan to re-arm and is setting up its military in Australia.
At the same time, the US is also meddling waters in the South China Sea to drive wedges between China and some of its Southeast Asian neighbors.
China should not cater to the US' call for it to be "transparent" regarding its military, which might "satisfy" the US but undermine China's interests.
