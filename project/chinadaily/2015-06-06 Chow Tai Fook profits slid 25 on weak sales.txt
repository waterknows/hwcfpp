Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd, the world's largest listed jewelry chain by revenue, reported a 25 percent decrease in full-year profit as sales struggled on the Chinese mainland and major markets such as Hong Kong and Macao. 
Net income for the 12 months ending March fell to HK$5.46 billion from HK$7.27 billion a year earlier, Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook said on Friday. This compares with the HK$5.9 billion average of 23 analyst-estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
The jeweler's sales have been hit as mainland shoppers cut back on luxury spending, mainland economic growth slows, and the government mounts an austerity campaign. Sales in Hong Kong also suffered in the second half of 2014 as pro-democracy protests forced some stores to close. 



Same-store-sales at outlets trading for at least a year fell 24 percent, Chow Tai Fook said. Revenue dropped to HK$64.28 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of HK$66.3 billion. 
Chow Tai Fook shares fell 0.3 percent to close at HK$9.18 in Hong Kong trading on Friday. This compares with the 1.1 percent drop in the Hang Seng Index, the city's benchmark. 
Chow Tai Fook reported in April that same-store-sales dropped 16 percent in the three months through March, dragged down by a 9 percent drop on the mainland and a 21 percent fall in Hong Kong, Macao and other markets. 
The jeweler "may announce shop closures in Hong Kong and Macao at its results meeting" on Friday, with the aim of cutting rent costs, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Catherine Lim wrote in a June 4 paper.
