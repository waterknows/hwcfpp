"I am delighted to see the progress in the jury system. The modifications, generally speaking, are on the right track of bringing more democracy to trials. I believe it will take years for reform of the jury system to achieve desired results. The pilot program initiated by the top court is only a start." 
ZENG XINHUA, a law professor at the University of International Business and Economics 
"According to the statistics I collected, it makes a big difference when jurors are involved in cases filed against government organizations. Only 1.7 percent of such cases have been ruled in favor of the administrative entities when they are tried by jurors, while 7.7 percent of such cases have been ruled in favor of the administrative entities when they are tried by a single judge." 
HE HAIBO, law professor at Tsinghua University 
"The jurors' participation in hearings has yet to be written into law. Concerns about how jurors discuss cases with judges and how the voting procedure works have yet to be discussed with the public." 
WEI JIE, partner in Jieqiang Law Firm in Beijing 
"In China, being a juror is not everyone's duty, so I am not aware that the system actually affects everyone. I hope the way in which the system works will be made more transparent to the public, especially in cases concerning major public interests."
