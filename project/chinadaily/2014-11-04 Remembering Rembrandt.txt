A retrospective art exhibition, Rembrandt and the Dutch Golden Age, opened at the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts on Thursday, displaying 178 paintings by some 100 artists. 
According to museum director Laszlo Baan, the exhibition marks the first time Hungary hosts a comprehensive display of Dutch art's golden age. 
Celebrated art historian Ildiko Ember, who curated the exhibit, says the world recognizes roughly 5,000 Dutch painters who worked at the time. This is the first time Hungarians have the chance to see a Vermeer painting at home, she says. 
At least 20 Rembrandt paintings are exhibited and reflect the artist's career from his early works to his last portraits, she adds. Three of Vermeer's works are also on display. 
The 17th century collection was put together by 44 museums from 10 countries, parliamentary speaker Laszlo Kover said at the exhibition's opening on Friday. It was also the golden era in Dutch history, Kover notes, citing its establishment of modern democracy with the creation of a merchant class and the formation of the stock exchange. That era of Dutch history served as an example to the Hungarians, he adds. 
Robert de Groot, chief of European cooperation in the Dutch foreign ministry, says the display offers a glimpse into the age of Rembrandt, Vermeer, Spinoza and Grotius. Many people contributed to the success of that epoch, he says. People came from all over Europe, including hundreds of Hungarian students fleeing religious persecution, de Groot adds. 
The exhibition runs through Feb 15.
