The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA), the second largest pro-establishment political party in the Legislative Council, will tentatively field 15 candidates in district council elections in November. 



The party currently has more than 20 elected and appointed district councilors. But the appointment system will end when the current term expires. Therefore, appointed district councilors wishing to continue their political careers will need to turn to direct elections. 
Announcing the list of candidates at a press conference on Tuesday, BPA Vice-Chairman Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung said they would field 15 candidates - with 14 seeking re-election. They may announce more candidates later. 
The party's campaign slogan is "A Stronger Economy, A Fairer Society". Its overall platform is: "Develop economy, enhance well-being, help community and bring about a better Hong Kong." 
Lam was asked whether the BPA candidates would clash with candidates from other pro-establishment parties or be challenged by people from the radical "umbrella groups". 
Lam could not say emphatically whether the BPA has come to terms with the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the Liberal Party or the New People's Party in the pro-establishment camp. 
According to sources, some appointed district councilors from the BPA will have to consider carefully whether they will participate in direct elections. This is why the party has not finalized its list of entrants. 
The Democratic Party, Labour Party and Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood will field 95, 12 and 25 candidates, respectively, in the district council elections.
