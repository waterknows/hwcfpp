 
Peking University acted as a launching point for the May 4th Movement, an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, political and cultural development in 1919. 
As the student movement gained momentum, some new ideologies in areas such as science and democracy emerged. 
At that time, the university acted as a cradle for these new principles, and its students were the movement's main catalysts. 
On the one hand, the university, as a place of academic freedom, independent thinking and truth seeking, provided fertile ground for young pioneers to spread the new theories, while on the other hand, the political movement pushed forward educational reform. 
To commemorate the movement, the university holds activities every year, including speeches by young leaders and singing competitions. Flowers are also given out to the university's young pioneers.
