Nepal's former Prime Minister and vice-chairman of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) Baburam Bhattarai said this in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency. Referring to the significance of the Chinese dream, Bhattarai said China has to play a leading role in bringing peace, stability and development to the world.
