China's V-Day parade on Thursday gained international gravitas, with rifle-carrying foreign troops clad in many uniforms marching with crisp footsteps and neatly choreographed movements across Beijing's Tian'anmen Square.
The display marked the country's endeavor to revive the forgotten memory that China and its global allies had joined hands to win a war against "the darkest forces ever" in the history of mankind 70 years ago.
Nearly 1,000 high-spirited soldiers from 17 countries marched in the wake of veterans and Chinese army formations, marking the foreign troops' premiere in a Chinese military parade.
Among them were forces from Belarus, Cuba, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, Mexico, Mongolia, Pakistan, Serbia, Tajikistan and Russia. Six other countries, including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Fiji, Laos, Vanuatu and Venezuela, marched their delegations for the parade.
Most of those countries were victims of World War II and some of them gained national independence as the postwar world order took shape.
They were observed by President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and government representatives including US Ambassador to China Max Baucus.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, former British prime minister Tony Blair and former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder were on the rostrum.
"China's contribution and sacrifice during the Second World War is very much recognized, appreciated for all such sufferings, and sympathized by the world's people," Ban Ki-moon said before the parade.
