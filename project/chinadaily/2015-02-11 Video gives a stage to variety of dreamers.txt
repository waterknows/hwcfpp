In contrast to past failed efforts for the same purpose, the international publicity video of the Communist Party of China has become a huge hit in China. Its success lies in its striking a chord with ordinary people. Instead of feeding audiences rigid ideological dogma, it simply displays the different dreams of a number of Chinese people. These are dreams most Chinese can relate to. 
It was to realize such dreams that China's leaders launched market-oriented reform 36 years ago. Over the ensuing years, reform and opening-up has released the potential of China's huge workforce, and created enormous social wealth. 
Even the staunchest supporters of market forces have come to realize the importance of people, out of whose hands come all the goods we consume. China is one of the few non-Western-democracies in this world. Despite the West's doubts, China has become a dynamic country with a stable society. Maybe the video best explains the legitimacy of the ruling Party - "Our people's dreams are our goals." The CPC's relationship with the Chinese people is unique and can be explained in terms of traditional Chinese culture only. 
It was by shouldering the responsibility "for the people's dreams to come true" that the CPC rallied people's support to found New China in 1949. Now the Party leadership is determined to realize those dreams. 
Of course, as the ruling Party, the CPC also faces great challenges as China is such a large country. No political system is 100 percent perfect in the world, but only under the leadership of the Party can the people achieve their dreams.
