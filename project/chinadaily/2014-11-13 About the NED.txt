The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) describes itself as a private, nonprofit foundation dedicated to growing and strengthening democratic institutions globally. It is funded by the US Congress and supports more than 1,000 NGO projects working for democratic goals in more than 90 countries. 
CIA historian William Blum describes NED as a Trojan Horse, set up in the 1980s to "do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades", meddling in the "internal affairs of numerous foreign countries by supplying funds, technical know-how and training". 
Blum notes NED has a track record of manipulating elections over its more than 20-year history, from Nicaragua to Mongolia, while helping to overthrow democratically-elected governments in Bulgaria, Albania and Slovakia. NED disregards free and fair elections in favor of people and political parties on its favorites' list.
